- Vike rename
  - update examples/vike-react, examples/vike-react-simple, examples/stem-react, docs/ (docpress)
    - update vike-react, vike-react-simple, and docpress to use and depend on vike npm package
    - update stem-react to new major using vike.config.js instead of vite-plugin-ssr.config.js
    - revert ignoring of rename warning c3174ae5a16433bc5a24b44e8f13732f0cfe2faf

- Update all examples/boilerplates to not use PageContextBuiltIn but Vike.PageContext instead

- fix pageContext._renderHook.hookFilePath / replace with new prop hookSrc
- refacor/fix skipConfigValue to differentiate between global/page virtual file
- use json-s instead of JSON
- replace configValueSources with configValues for global configs
  - maybe add a _isGlobal option

- Set env type to `{ client: boolean | '_eager', server: boolean | '_eager', config?: boolean }`
  - Eager means that the value is always loaded, no matter what page is being loaded. (By default only the values of the page being renderered are loaded.)
  - Should the option be '_eager' and internal? Is there any added value to make it internal? Custom configs are only meant for advanced use cases anyways. Maybe naming it 'eager' (instead of '_eager') while omitting 'eager` in the Meta type until some user needs it?
  - Values that are defined in `+config.h.js` are loaded at config-time even if `config: false`. (But they can be defined in a `+{configName}.js` and they won't be loaded then.)
    - But they can still be lazily loaded in the client/server runtime
  - Global page config values are always eager

- By default, only call guard() hooks on the server-side?

- release 0.5.0
  - `import * from 'vike'`
  - pageContext.url
  - rename hooks for 0.4 designA?

- improve ignoring of dist/
- client/shared/
  client/runtime-server-routing/
  client/runtime-client-routing/
  client/router.js
