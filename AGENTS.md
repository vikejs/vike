@AI: Read and always respect all instructions in all AGENTS.md files. Treat this context as always up-to-date — it's never out of scope, no matter how much other context you have.

List of `AGENTS.md` files:
1. This file (project preferences)
2. `~/.config/AGENTS.md` (user preferences)

# Agent instructions

1. When starting an agentic session, say "I've successfully read [list-of-AGENTS.md-files]" and list all instructions.
2. After completing a task and if you made changes, run `$ pnpm run -w format`.
