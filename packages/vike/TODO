= TODO/now
- Add vike.dev/config#cumulative
- Add vike.dev/config#global
  - Remove all other #global sections

= TODO/soon
- Add assertWarning() deprecations:
  - `pageContext.exports`
  - `pageContext.configEntries`
- Soft depracate TS helpers such as OnRenderHtmlAsync https://vike.dev/onRenderHtml#typescript
- Soft deprecate returning `pageContext` from `onBeforeRender()`
  - Depecrate all return values of `onBeforeRender()`, `onRenderHtml`, and all hooks?
    - Including `documentHtml` and `injectFilter()`
      - Use pageContext.html and pageContext.injectFilter instead
- pageContext.url + soft deprecate pageContext.urlParsed
  - Add negligible breaking change
  - Maybe/eventually: `$ pnpm migrate pageContext.url`? Probably not for now: instead recommend `$ rename urlParsed url`.

= TO-DO/next-major-release:
== Highest Prio
- Triage https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22v1%20release%20%3Astar2%3A%22 and remove non-breaking changes => release new feature in `1.x.x` release branch
- Remove old design
- Remove TS helpers such as OnRenderHtmlAsync https://vike.dev/onRenderHtml#typescript
- Make routing fully sync
  - Forbid async Route Functions
- Make CJS warning an error
  - Keep the CJS build for a little while and if no one complains then remove the CJS build
== Prio
- Simplify import paths
  - Migration script => not too annoying for the user? All the user has to do to update to `v1.0.0` is:
    1. Follow all soft deprecation warnings
    2. Run `$ vike update`
    > [!INFO]
    > Although this would require +config.oldApiInterop.nonCumulativeHooks to avoid breaking change => but I think it isn't worth it? Let's be lazy?
  - Either move all isomorphic exports to `import * from 'vike'` or create individual export path for each export e.g. `import { render } from 'vike/render'`
    - E.g. remove `import * from 'vike/abort'` and `import * from 'vike/client'`
      ```diff
      - import * from 'vike/client/router'
      + import * from 'vike'
      // Or:
      + import { navigate } from 'vike/navigate'
      + import { prefetch } from 'vike/prefetch'
      ```
    - How about `vike/server`?
      - This one can probably stay bundled as loaded superfluous code on the server-side is probably ok, but let's double check how big the loaded superfluous code can be.
  - How about 'vike/types'? I guess move it to 'vike' iff. moving all isomorphics to 'vike'.
  - `import { navigate } from 'vike/navigate'`
- Make hooks cumulative by default
 - +data and +onBeforeRender https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1833
 - +onHydrationEnd
 - +guard
 - +onPageTransitionStart ?
 - more/most?
 - Works well with +data.noInherit.js and +onPageTransitionStart.default.js https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1692
- Cleanup after old design removal:
  - Make client entry be a single virtual file
    - Remove `import * as virtualFileExports from 'virtual:vike:entry:client:...'`
      - We can then avoid adding client runtime entry to optimizeDeps.exclude
    - Make +client.js cumulative https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1834
    - Fix non-global +client.js
      - For example, make `import '@batijs/elements'` work for Vike's docs.
== Maybe
- Rename hooks
  - Soft deprecation + migration scripts => hook renaming not too annoying for the user?
  - Rename +on{After}RenderClient to +onRenderClient{Start,End} ?
  - Rename +onData => +onAfterData ? Maybe not because it isn't strictly always called after +data
