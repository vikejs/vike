- Update boilerplates to use Hono
- Add vike.dev/config#cumulative
- Add vike.dev/config#global
  - Remove all other #global sections
- Move packages/{vike.dev,telefunc.com} to docs/ ?

- Rename +onData => +onAfterData ? Maybe not because it isn't strictly always called after +data
- Rename +on{After}RenderClient to +onRenderClient{Start,End} ?
  - Soft deprecate it (instead of adding a breaking change note)

v0.5 breaking changes:
=== Hihgest Prio
- Deprecate old design
- Remove TS helpers such as OnRenderHtmlAsync https://vike.dev/onRenderHtml#typescript
- Make routing fully sync
  - Forbid async Route Functions
=== Prio
- pageContext.url
- Improve/clean import paths.
  - Either move all isomorphic exports to `import * from 'vike'` or create individual export path for each export e.g. `import { render } from 'vike/render'`
    - E.g. remove `import * from 'vike/abort'` and `import * from 'vike/client'`
      ```diff
      - import * from 'vike/client/router'
      + import * from 'vike'
      // Or:
      + import { navigate } from 'vike/navigate'
      + import { prefetch } from 'vike/prefetch'
      ```
    - How about `vike/server`?
      - This one can probably stay bundled as loaded superfluous code on the server-side is probably ok, but let's double check how big the loaded superfluous code can be.
  - How about 'vike/types'? I guess move it to 'vike' iff. moving all isomorphics to 'vike'.
  - `import { navigate } from 'vike/navigate'`
- See & categorize/prioritize all TODOs in source code
- See v1-release tickets https://github.com/vikejs/vike/labels/v1%20release%20%3Astar2%3A such as:
  - https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/2107
  - https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1851
- Make cumulative by default:
 - +onHydrationEnd
 - +guard
 - +onPageTransitionStart ?
 - more/most?
- Move `dist/assets.json` to `dist/server/assets.json`
  - Or move it `dist/server/assets-client.json` to?
  - Or remove it altogether in favor of `globalContext.assetsManifest`?
- Make navigate() automatically add Base URL by default?
- Make client entry be a single virtual file
  - Remove `import * as virtualFileExports from 'virtual:vike:entry:client:...'`
    - We can then avoid adding client runtime entry to optimizeDeps.exclude
  - Make +client.js cumulative https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1834
  - Fix non-global +client.js
    - For example, make `import '@batijs/elements'` work for Vike's docs.
=== Maybe
- Make +data and +onBeforeRender cumulative https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1833
- Forbid content-type
  - Maybe use x-powered-by header to check & enforce usage of pageContext.httpResponse.headers
- Remove dist/server/importBuild.{cjs,mjs,js}
- See vike.dev/migration/v0.5
  - See also vike.dev/migration/v1
  - Shall all breaking changes be listed or is it enough to say "first update to latest 0.4.x then follow all warnings then update to 0.5"?
- Set `cjsInterop: true` by default?
- Communicate that v0.5 essentially is the v1.0.0 in disguise: the plan is to eventually rename the latest `v0.5.x` to `v1.0.0`.
  - The plan for releasing the v1.0.0 being:
    - Implement feature requests considered essential, most notably: [#562 - Transpile server code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/562)
    - Make a big release announcement and blog post with a completely rehauled landing page.
      - Blog post: my personal journey towards building Vike (for rationle why Vike exists, see landing page instead of reading blog bost).
- Make CJS warning an error.
  - Keep the CJS build for a little while and if no one complains then remove the CJS build.
- Make guard() hook server-side only by default?
- Presrve scroll for route parameters other than the first one?
  - https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1459
- Remove deprecated API support in getPrefetchSettings.ts
  - Remove all deprecated API, at least in client code?
- New Base URL setting: https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1794
- Simplify pageContext return type?
- Deprecate returning `pageContext` from `onBeforeRender()`
  - Depecrate all return values of `onBeforeRender()`, `onRenderHtml`, and all hooks?
    - Including `documentHtml` and `injectFilter()`
  - Remove hook types such as `OnBeforeRenderAsync` https://vike.dev/onBeforeRender#typescript

- Add assertWarning() deprecations:
  - `pageContext.exports`
  - `pageContext.configEntries`
