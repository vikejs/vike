- Make navigate() automatically add Base URL by default?

- Update boilerplates to use Hono
- Add vike.dev/config#cumulative
- Add vike.dev/config#global
  - Remove all other #global sections
- Move packages/{vike.dev,telefunc.com} to docs/ ?

- Add assertWarning() deprecations:
  - `pageContext.exports`
  - `pageContext.configEntries`

- Triage TODOs in source code

===== Upcoming breaking changes ===
=== Highest Prio
- Deprecate old design
- Remove TS helpers such as OnRenderHtmlAsync https://vike.dev/onRenderHtml#typescript
- Make routing fully sync
  - Forbid async Route Functions
- Make CJS warning an error
  - Keep the CJS build for a little while and if no one complains then remove the CJS build
=== Prio
- pageContext.url
- Simplify import paths
  - Either move all isomorphic exports to `import * from 'vike'` or create individual export path for each export e.g. `import { render } from 'vike/render'`
    - E.g. remove `import * from 'vike/abort'` and `import * from 'vike/client'`
      ```diff
      - import * from 'vike/client/router'
      + import * from 'vike'
      // Or:
      + import { navigate } from 'vike/navigate'
      + import { prefetch } from 'vike/prefetch'
      ```
    - How about `vike/server`?
      - This one can probably stay bundled as loaded superfluous code on the server-side is probably ok, but let's double check how big the loaded superfluous code can be.
  - How about 'vike/types'? I guess move it to 'vike' iff. moving all isomorphics to 'vike'.
  - `import { navigate } from 'vike/navigate'`
- Make hooks cumulative by default
 - +onHydrationEnd
 - +guard
 - +onPageTransitionStart ?
 - more/most?
- Cleanup after old design removal:
  - Make client entry be a single virtual file
    - Remove `import * as virtualFileExports from 'virtual:vike:entry:client:...'`
      - We can then avoid adding client runtime entry to optimizeDeps.exclude
    - Make +client.js cumulative https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1834
    - Fix non-global +client.js
      - For example, make `import '@batijs/elements'` work for Vike's docs.
- Deprecate returning `pageContext` from `onBeforeRender()`
  - Depecrate all return values of `onBeforeRender()`, `onRenderHtml`, and all hooks?
    - Including `documentHtml` and `injectFilter()`
  - Remove hook types such as `OnBeforeRenderAsync` https://vike.dev/onBeforeRender#typescript
=== Maybe
- Make +data and +onBeforeRender cumulative https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1833
- Forbid content-type
  - Maybe use x-powered-by header to check & enforce usage of pageContext.httpResponse.headers
- Remove dist/server/importBuild.{cjs,mjs,js}
- See vike.dev/migration/v0.5
  - See also vike.dev/migration/v1
  - Shall all breaking changes be listed or is it enough to say "first update to latest 0.4.x then follow all warnings then update to 0.5"?
- Make guard() hook server-side only by default?
- Presrve scroll for route parameters other than the first one?
  - https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1459
=== Probably later
- Rename hooks
  - Soft deprecation + migration scripts?
  - Rename +on{After}RenderClient to +onRenderClient{Start,End} ?
  - Rename +onData => +onAfterData ? Maybe not because it isn't strictly always called after +data
