We recommend the following setup.

In development, we use *two* servers:
 1. We use Vite's development server. (It automatically includes Vike's server middleware.)
 1. We use our hapi server *without* Vite nor Vike.

This means that in development, Vite is responsible for serving the entire frontend, while our hapi server is responsible only for serving the backend.

> When using Express.js we usually integrate the Vite development middleware to Express.js but we cannot do that with hapi, because hapi doesn't support connect middlewares (the Vite development middleware is a connect middleware). See

>  - [GitHub > hapi > Express/Connect middleware support (#80)](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/80)

In production, we use only *one* server:
 1. Our hapi server that serves the backend *as well* as the frontend: it serves the static files living at `dist/client/` and does server-side rendering by using Vike's <Link text={<code>renderPage()</code>} href="/renderPage" />.
