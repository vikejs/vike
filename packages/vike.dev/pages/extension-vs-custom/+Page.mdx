With Vike, you have the choice between:
- Using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>, for a quick start.
- Implementing your own custom integrations, for full control over how tools are integrated.

We recommend always using Vike extensions while falling back to custom integrations only if you have a clear reason.

> Vike extensions are highly polished integrations. But they're also slightly opinionated and may not fit what you need.

For example:
 - Start using Vike with <UiFrameworkExtension name />.
 - If you run into an issue/blocker with <UiFrameworkExtension succinct />, then start a discussion with the maintainers of <UiFrameworkExtension succinct /> on GitHub.
 - If a maintainer of <UiFrameworkExtension succinct /> replies that resolving your issue/blocker is out-of-scope, then start considering a custom integration.

> You can also <Link href="/eject">eject Vike extensions</Link> to fully and/or progressively customize extensions.
