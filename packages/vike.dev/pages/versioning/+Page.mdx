Upgrades that keep the leading digit (e.g. 0.4.x → 0.4.y or 1.x.y → 1.z.w) are generally non-breaking.

Vike doesn't strictly follow [semver](https://semver.org):
1. **Features can be introduced in any version update**.
2. **Minor breaking changes can be introduced in any version update**.
   <blockquote>
   These [`MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) are expected to affect only *very* few users.

   It considerably speeds up Vike’s development. For example, to [quickly fix bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%20%3Aboom%3A%22): if Vike has incorrect behavior and fixing it benefits almost all users but causes a breaking change for a handful of users, we still prioritize the fix over strict semver adherence.

> Don't hesitate to reach out if updating Vike breaks your app, we will fix the regression. (Or provide guidance if it's a `MINOR BREAKING CHANGE`.)


## Warnings

Vike sometimes adds a warning when an API will be deprecated in the next major release.

For example:

```
[Vike][Warning] Using Vite's CLI will be deprecated in the next major release, use
Vike's CLI instead.
```

You can migrate whenever you want — the old API and the new API are both supported until the next major release.

> It isn't a breaking change; therefore, such warnings can be introduced in any version update.
