Welcome to Vike ðŸ”¨

This guide will walk your through your first steps using Vike.

## Scaffold your first Vike app

Use <Link href="/new">vike.dev/new</Link> to scaffold a new Vike app.

You can skip exploring the scaffolder's UI for now and directly run the following command instead:

<BatiCmd />

> This scaffolds a Vike app that uses <UiFrameworkExtension name /> which are the official React, Vue, and Solid integrations maintained by the Vike team.
>
> While we recommend using <UiFrameworkExtension name noLink /> you can also <Link href="/new#without-vike-react-vue-solid">manually integrate React/Vue/Solid yourself</Link>.

Then:

```bash
# Install dependencies:
pnpm install
# Start your app:
pnpm run dev
```

You can now go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) <span class="gray">(or [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) if `localhost:3000` is busy)</span>.

You created your first Vike app ðŸŽ‰

Your app is:
- A rich interactive client-side app.
  - TO-DO: add screenshot of interactive counter.
- Server-side rendered (SSR) for optimized SEO (the page's content is rendered to HTML).
  - TO-DO: add screenshot of HTML
