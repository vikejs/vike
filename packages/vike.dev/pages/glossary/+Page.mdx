Common terminology used in web development.


## Isomorphic

*Isomorphic code* (aka *universal code*) is code that can be loaded and executed on both the client- and server-side.


## HMR

*HMR* (**H**ot **M**odule **R**eplacement, aka live reload) is a development feature that updates modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload, preserving application state.

## SSG

*SSG* (**S**tatic **S**ite **G**eneration, aka pre-rendering) is a web development approach where all pages are pre-rendered to HTML at build time, so that your app consists only of static assets that can be deployed to a static host which is fast, easy, and inexpensive (usually free).

Technically speaking: an SSG app is an app where *all* pages are pre-rendered (<Link href="/prerender#partial">`prerender.partial`</Link> is `false`).

For more information see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
