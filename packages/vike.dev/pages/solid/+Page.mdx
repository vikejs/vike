## `vike-solid`

We recommend using <Link href="/vike-solid">`vike-solid`</Link> which integrates [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com) in a full-fledged manner.

> <UseScaffolder>`vike-solid`</UseScaffolder>

You can also <Link href="#custom-integration">integrate Solid yourself</Link> if you want full control over the Solid integration.


## Custom integration

Instead of using <Link href="/vike-solid">`vike-solid`</Link>, you can implement your own Solid integration, for full control over the integration of Solid and Solid libraries.

<CustomIntegrationWarning list={['vike-solid']} />

Official example:
 - [`vike-solid` source code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-solid/tree/main/vike-solid) - Full-featured integration.
