## Npm packages containing invalid code

Some npm packages contain invalid JavaScript code that can crash Node.js.

The usual workaround is to add the npm package to `vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal`, see <Link href="/broken-npm-package" />.


## Hydration mismatch

If you use <Link href="/ssr">SSR</Link> then a recurring issue are so-called *hydration mismatches*: a hydration mismatch is when the content rendered to HTML on the server isn't the same as the content rendered in the browser.

See <Link href="/hydration-mismatch" /> for explanations, solutions, and workarounds.
