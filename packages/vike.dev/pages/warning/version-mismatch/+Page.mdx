[Vike][Warning] vike@1.2.3 and vike@1.2.4 loaded which is highly discouraged
```

This warning means that two different Vike versions (`vike@1.2.3` and `vike@1.2.4`) are being loaded, which is strongly discouraged in production.

We recommend using a single Vike installation. (If Vike is installed in multiple locations, we recommend ensuring the installed versions are the same. At the very least, you must ensure that only one Vike version is loaded at runtime.)

<Warning>
  **Don't deploy to production if you see the warning above**, as you run into the risks of:
   - Bugs that cannot be fixed (Vike internally assumes that only Vike version is loaded).
   - Client-side bloat (unnecessary KBs loaded as multiple Vike versions are loaded).
   - In some cases, security issues.

  That said, you can temporarily ignore the warning during development. (For example, it's common to temporarily link npm packages during development which can lead to multiple `node_modules/vike/` installations with different versions.)
</Warning>

<Contribution>
  Contributions welcome to create a guide on how to dedupe multiple Vike versions.
