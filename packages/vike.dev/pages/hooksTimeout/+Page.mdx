<Warning>This is a V1 design only feature: make sure to 1. update Vike to the latest version and 2. <Link href="/migration/v1-design">migrate to the V1 design</Link>.</Warning>

If a <Link href="/hooks">hook</Link> returns a promise that takes too much time to resolve, then Vike logs an error and your <Link href="/error-page">error page</Link> is rendered.

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```bash
# Vike first logs a warning (still awaiting your hook)
[vike][Warning] The data() hook defined by /pages/movies/+data.js is slow: it's taking more than 4 seconds
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```bash
# Then Vike logs an error (and renders your error page)
[vike][Error] The data() hook defined by /pages/movies/+data.js timed out: it didn't finish after 30 seconds
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>

You can configure the timeout of hooks:

```js
// +config.js

export default {
  hooksTimeout: {
    data: {
      // Increase warning timeout to 5 seconds
      warning: 5 * 1000,
      // Increase error timeout to one minute
      error: 60 * 1000
    }
  }
}
```

## Disable

You can disable timeouts:

```js
// +config.js

export default {
  hooksTimeout: {
    data: {
      // Disable the warning timeout
      warning: false
    }
    // No timeout at all: Vike won't warn and will indefinitely await the
    // promise returned by onRenderClient()
    onRenderClient: false
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  We strongly discourage this practice:
   - You may always want to be informed when one of your hooks is slowing down your UI.
   - Showing an error page is usually a better UX than displaying a UI that hangs indefinitely.
   - If your server doesn't time out long running HTTP requests, then you have a memory leak.
  Instead, consider increasing timeouts as the need arises.
</Warning>

You can also disable timeouts for all hooks:

```js
// +config.js

export default {
  // We strongly recommend against this
  hooksTimeout: false
}
```
