import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'
import { UiFrameworkExtension } from '../../components'

Implemented by: <UiFrameworkExtension /> (or <Link href="#without-vike-react-vue-solid">yourself</Link>).

The `clientOnly()` helper enables you to load and render a component only on the client-side.

> Alternatively, you can set <Link href="/ssr">`ssr: false`</Link> to load and render the entire page on the client-side only.

Common use cases:

 - **Library components that don't support SSR**. A solution is to render and load the component only on the client-side.
   > Most component libraries nowadays support SSR but some don't. Some even crash when they're merely loaded on the server-side (for example if the library has a hard reference to browser-only APIs such as `window`).
 - **Performance**. `clientOnly()` allows you to defer loading heavy components, such as a complex interactive map. That way, your users can already interact with your page before even the browser starts loading that heavy component.
   > Vite code-splits dynamic imports such as `const { SomeComponent } = await import('./SomeComponent')`. In other words, the code of `<SomeComponent />` isn't included in the initial JavaScript client bundle: it's loaded only when/if `import()` is called.


## React

### Usage

```tsx
import { clientOnly } from 'vike-react/clientOnly'

const SomeComponent = clientOnly(() => import("./SomeComponent.jsx"));
/* If the component isn't the default export:
const SomeComponent = clientOnly(async () => (await import('some-library')).SomeComponent)
*/

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <SomeComponent fallback={<Loading />} />
}
```

#### Props

- **fallback**: Content shown while the component is being loaded.

All other props are passed to the loaded component.


## Solid

### Usage

```tsx
import { clientOnly } from 'vike-solid/clientOnly'

const SomeComponent = clientOnly(() => import("./SomeComponent.jsx"));
/* If the component isn't the default export:
const SomeComponent = clientOnly(async () => (await import('some-library')).SomeComponent)
*/

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <SomeComponent fallback={<Loading />} />
}
```

#### Props

- **fallback**: Content shown while the component is being loaded.

All other props are passed to the loaded component.


## Vue

```vue
<template>
  <SomeComponent>
    <template #fallback>
      <p>Loading...</p>
    </template>
  </SomeComponent>
</template>

<script setup>
import clientOnly from 'vike-vue/clientOnly'
const SomeComponent = clientOnly(() => import('./SomeComponent.vue'))
/* If the component isn't the default export:
const SomeComponent = clientOnly(async () => (await import('some-library')).SomeComponent)
*/
</script>
```

#### Props

All props are passed to the loaded component.

#### Slots

- **fallback**: Content shown while the component is being loaded.
- **client-only-fallback**: Use it instead of the `#fallback` slot in case of conflicts.

All slots are passed to the loaded component.


## Without `vike-{react,vue,solid}`

If you don't use a <UiFrameworkExtension />, you can implement the `clientOnly()` helper yourself.
