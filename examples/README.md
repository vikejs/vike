For more examples, see [vike.dev/examples](https://vike.dev/examples) which includes many community examples not listed here.

> [!NOTE]
> For creating a new Vike app, we recommend using [Bati](https://batijs.dev) instead of copying the examples here. Because all examples here use a custom React/Vue integration instead of using `vike-react`/`vike-vue` which [we generally don't recommend](https://vike.dev/new#without-vike-react-vue-solid).
