For more examples, see [vike.dev/tools](https://vike.dev/tools) which includes many community examples not listed here.

> [!NOTE]
> For scaffolding new Vike apps, we recommend using [Bati](https://batijs.dev) instead of copying the examples here. The examples use a custom React/Vue integration instead of using `vike-react`/`vike-vue` which [we generally don't recommend](https://vike.dev/new/core).
