Example of using Vike with React Router.

This example completely replaces Vike's built-in router with React Router. Alternatively we can:
 - Use React Router only for a single or a couple pages.
 - Deeply integrate React Router with Vike's router. (:construction: Work-in-progress: follow this [ticket](https://github.com/brillout/vike/issues/9) and this [PR](https://github.com/brillout/vike/pull/40).)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brillout/vike
cd vike/examples/react-router/
npm install
npm run dev
```
