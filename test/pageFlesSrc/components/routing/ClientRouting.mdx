import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

By default `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server Routing. We can opt into Client Routing by setting the <Link text={<><code>clientRouting</code> option</>} href="/clientRouting" /> option to `true`.

*Client(-side) Routing* denotes the practice of implementing page navigation on the client-side:
when the user navigates to a new page,
instead of completely discarding the current page and requesting the HTML of the new page,
the current page is preserved and the new page is rendered by manipulating the DOM of the page.

Client Routing enables:
- Faster page navigation.
- Client-side state preserved across navigation.
- Nested Layouts.
- Custom page transition animations.
