import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

This setting is global: its value always applies to all your pages. In other words, it doesn't support <Link href="/config#inheritance">config inheritance</Link>.

> You cannot set it at `pages/some-page/+config.js`: you have to set it at `pages/+config.js` (or some other global location) instead.

> If you want to set different values for different pages, then consider creating a custom setting as shown at <Link href="/head-tags#custom-settings" />.
