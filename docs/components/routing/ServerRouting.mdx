*Server(-side) Routing* is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the HTML of the new page is loaded.

Server Routing usually leads to a simpler app architecture and, consequently, to a higher development speed.

We use <Link text={<code>getPage()</code>} href="/getPage" /> to implement Server Routing.
