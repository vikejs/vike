Client-side rendered pages (aka *client-side rendering*, *CSR*, *SPA*) are pages that are rendered only on the client-side. In other words, all the page's UI components are loaded and executed only on the client-side and never on the server-side.

See <Link href="/ssr" /> for configuring which of your pages should be rendered on the client-side and/or server-side.

See <Link href="/SPA-vs-SSR" /> for a guide on whether to choose client-side and/or serve-side rendering.
