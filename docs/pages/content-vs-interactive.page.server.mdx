To decided between SSR and SPA, we discriminate between two types of apps:
 - *Content-centric*: the value of the page is mostly about content (e.g. a newspaper or a blog).
 - *Interactive-centric*: the value of the page is mostly about interaction (e.g. a to-do list app, an online image editor, or an admin-panel).
