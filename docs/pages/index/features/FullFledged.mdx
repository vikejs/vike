### Fast HMR

Blazing fast HMR powered by Vite <ViteLogo />.

HMR stays fast as you scale thanks to Vite's novel lazy-transpiling approach.

### Routing

Pages are automatically routed:
```
FILESYSTEM                        URL
pages/index.page.js               /
pages/about.page.js               /about
pages/faq/index.page.js           /faq
pages/movie/@id/index.page.js     /movie/1, /movie/2, /movie/3, ...
```

You can also use so-called *Route Strings* and *Route Functions*.
```js
// Route String
export default '/movie/@id'

// Route Function — for full flexibility
export default pageContext => pageContext.urlPathname === '/admin' && pageContext.isAdmin
```

You can choose between:

- Client Routing for a faster page navigation. (DOM mutation upon page navigation.)
- Server Routing for a simpler app architecture. (Full HTML reload upon page navigation.)

### Render Modes (SSR, SPA, SSG, HTML-only)

For each page, you can choose between:
 - SSR: the page's HTML is rendered at request-time.
 - SSG: the page's HTML is pre-rendered at build-time.
 - SPA: the page is not rendered to HTML; it's only loaded & rendered in the browser.
 - HTML-only: the page is rendered only to HTML with zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript.

For example, you can render an admin panel as an SPA while rendering marketing pages only to HTML with zero browser-side JavaScript.

This very website, `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com`, is HTML-only and loads only few KBs of JavaScript (which implements the few bits of interactivity such as
the collapsible `LEARN MORE` sections of this page).
