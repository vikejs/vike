For increased robustness and agility, Vike doesn't strictly follow [semver](https://semver.org):
1. **Features can be introduced in any version update**.
2. **Negligible breaking changes can be introduced in any version update**.
   <blockquote>
   These "negligible breaking changes" are rare and expected to affect only very few users.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
   It gives Vike more flexibility, for example, in [systematically and quickly fixing bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%20%3Aboom%3A%22): if Vike has an incorrect behavior, and fixing it benefits almost all users but is a regression for a handful (and thus, strictly speaking, a breaking change), we prioritize fixing it over strict semver adherence.
   </blockquote>

Similarly to semver, you can assume that upgrading from `0.4.x` to `0.4.y` or from `1.x.y` to `1.z.w` will (almost) never break your app.


## Warnings

Vike adds warnings whenever an API will be deprecated in the next major release (e.g. from `1.x.y` to `2.0.0`).

These warnings give you plenty of time to migrate at your own pace, as both the old and new API are supported simultaneously until the next major version.

Since these aren't breaking changes, new warnings can be introduced in any version update.
