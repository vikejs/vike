In order to further make Vike robust and lean, Vike doesn't strictly follows [semver](https://semver.org).

Most notabily:
- Like semver, there are no breaking changes when upgrading from `0.4.x` to `0.4.y` or from `1.x.y` to `1.z.w`, except for negligible breaking changes (see below).
- Unlike semver, negligible breaking changes can be introduced at any version update.
  > *Negligible breaking changes* are rare and and are expected to affect only a few dozen users.

Also unlike semver, features can be introduced at any version update.
