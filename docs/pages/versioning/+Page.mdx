For increased robustness and agility, Vike doesn't strictly follow [semver](https://semver.org):
1. Negligible breaking changes can be introduced in any version update.
   <blockquote>
   This is rare and expected to affect only very few users.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
   This flexibility allows us to [systematically and quickly fix bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%20%3Aboom%3A%22). For example, fixing a Vike wrong behavior that is beneficial for all users except of a handful of users for whom the behavior change is regression is, stritly speaking, a breaking change but we prioritize fixing the issue over strict semver adherence.
   </blockquote>
2. Features can be introduced in any version update.

As with semver, upgrading from `0.4.x` to `0.4.y` or from `1.x.y` to `1.z.w` is safe, without major breaking changes.
