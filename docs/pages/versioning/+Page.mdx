For increased robustness and agility, Vike doesn't strictly follow [semver](https://semver.org):
1. **Features can be introduced in any version update**.
2. **Minor breaking changes can be introduced in any version update**.
   <blockquote>
   These [`MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) are rare and expected to affect only very few users.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
   It gives Vike more flexibility, for example, in [quickly fixing bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%20%3Aboom%3A%22): if Vike has an incorrect behavior, and fixing it benefits almost all users but is a regression for a handful (and thus, strictly speaking, a breaking change), we prioritize fixing it over strict semver adherence.
   </blockquote>

Similarly to semver, you can assume that upgrading from `0.4.x` to `0.4.y` or from `1.x.y` to `1.z.w` won't break your app. (Expect of the very rare situation you are affected by a minor breaking change.)

> Don't hesitate to reach out if updating Vike breaks your app, we will fix the regression. (Or provide guidance if it's a `MINOR BREAKING CHANGE`.)


## Warnings

Vike sometimes adds a warning when an API will be deprecated in the next major release (e.g. from `1.x.y` to `2.0.0`).

For example:

```
[Vike][Warning] Using Vite's CLI will be deprecated in the next major release, use
Vike's CLI instead.
```

These warnings give you plenty of time to migrate at your own pace, as both the old and new API are supported simultaneously until the next major release.

Since these aren't breaking changes, new warnings can be introduced in any version update.
