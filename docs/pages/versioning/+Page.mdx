Upgrades that keep the leading digit (e.g. `0.4.x` => `0.4.y` or `1.x.y` => `1.z.w`) are generally non-breaking.

But note that Vike doesn't strictly follow [semver](https://semver.org):
1. Features can be introduced in any version update.
2. `MINOR BREAKING CHANGES` (see [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)) can be introduced in any version update.
   <blockquote>
   They affect very few users, and you're highly unlikely to be one of them. So we recommend that you ignore them — unless the update breaks your app.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
   It considerably speeds up Vike’s development. For example, it enables Vike to [quickly fix bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%20%3Aboom%3A%22): if Vike behaves incorrectly and fixing it helps nearly everyone but breaks things for very few users, we prioritize the fix over strict semver adherence.
   </blockquote>

If updating breaks your app, check the [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for any `MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`. If none are listed — or they don't apply to you — reach out: we'll consider it a regression and fix it.


## Warnings

Vike sometimes adds a warning when an API will be deprecated in the next major release.

For example:

```
[Vike][Warning] Using Vite's CLI will be deprecated in the next major release, use
Vike's CLI instead.
```

You can migrate whenever you want — the old API and the new API are both supported until the next major release.

> It isn't a breaking change; therefore, such warnings can be introduced in any version update.
