Vike only partially follows [semver](https://semver.org).
- Like semver, there isn't any breaking changes from going from `0.4.x` to `0.4.y` or from `1.x.y` to `1.z.w`. (Expect of minor breaking changes, see below.)
- Unlike semver, features as well as negligle breaking changes can be released in any version update.
  > With *negligle breaking changes* we mean breaking changes that we expect will only affect a few dozen users.
