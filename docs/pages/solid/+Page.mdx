## `vike-solid`

We recommend using <Link href="/extensions">`vike-solid`</Link> which integrates [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com) in a full-fledged manner.

> <UseBati>`vike-solid`</UseBati>

You can also <Link href="#without-vike-extension">integrate Solid yourself</Link> if you want full control over the Solid integration.


## Without Vike extension

Instead of using a Vike extension, you can manually integrate Solid yourself, giving you full control over the integration of not only Solid itself but also Solid libraries.

Official example:
 - [`vike-solid` source code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-solid/tree/main/vike-solid) - Full-featured integeration.

Community examples:

 - <Example timestamp="2024.01" repo="birkskyum/vike-with-solid-spa" /> - Solid + SPA + Server Routing.
 - <Example timestamp="2023.06" repo="inlang/monorepo" /> - Source code of [`inlang.com`](https://inlang.com/) which is built with Vike and Solid.
 - <Example timestamp="2023.02" repo="vchirikov/vite-plugin-ssr-solidjs-blog-example" /> - Homepage + Blog example.
   > vite-plugin-ssr was the [previous name of Vike](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/vike).
