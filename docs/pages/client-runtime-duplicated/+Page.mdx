If you get this warning:

```
[vike][Warning] Client runtime loaded twice
```

Then this means that the page has loaded more than one copy of Vike's client runtime. In other words, the client runtime's source code is included twice (or more) inside the client-side bundle.

In order to reduce the size of your client, make sure your client-side JavaScript includes Vike's client runtime only once.

You can inspect where Vike's client runtime is included twice:

```ts
// vite.config.ts

import type { UserConfig } from 'vite'

export default {
  // Temporarily disable minification to make it easier to inspect /dist/client
  build: { minify: false }
} satisfies UserConfig
```

```bash
cd dist/client/
grep -r 'loaded twice'
```
