Common terminology used in web development.


## Isomorphic

*Isomorphic code* (aka *universal code*) is code that can be loaded and executed on both the client- and server-side.


## HMR

{/* spellcheck-ignore */}
*HMR* (**H**ot **M**odule **R**eplacement, aka live reload)
is a development feature that updates modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload, preserving application state.

## SPA

{/* spellcheck-ignore */}
*SPA* (**S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication)
refers to rendering components exclusively on the client-side (in the browser), see:
- <Link href="/what-is-SSR-and-SPA" />
- <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" />

See also:
- <Link href="#ssr" />
- <Link href="#ssg" />


## SSR

{/* spellcheck-ignore */}
*SSR* (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering)
refers to rendering components to HTML on the server-side and then hydrating them (making them interactive) on the client-side, see:
- <Link href="/what-is-SSR-and-SPA" />

The main motivation for doing SSR is to improve SEO and AI discovery (it makes your page's content available to the crawlers of AI and search engines), see:
- <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" />

- <Link href="#ssg" />


## SSG

*SSG* (**S**tatic **S**ite **G**eneration, aka pre-rendering) is a web development approach where all pages are pre-rendered to HTML at build time, so that your app consists only of static assets that can be deployed to a static host which is fast, easy, and inexpensive (usually free), see:
- <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.

> Technically, an SSG app is an app where *all* pages are pre-rendered (i.e. <Link href="/prerender#partial">`prerender.partial`</Link> is `false`).
