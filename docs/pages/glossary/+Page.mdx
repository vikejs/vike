Common terminology used in web development.


## Isomorphic

## HMR

{/* spellcheck-ignore */}
*HMR* (**H**ot **M**odule **R**eplacement, aka live reload) is a development feature that updates modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload, preserving application state.

## SSR

**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering (SSR) denotes the practice of rendering a page to HTML on the server-side.

The main motivation for doing SSR is to improve SEO and AI discovery (it makes your page's content available to the crawlers of AI and search engines), see <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" />.

## SSG

*SSG* (**S**tatic **S**ite **G**eneration, aka pre-rendering) is a web development approach where all pages are pre-rendered to HTML at build time, so that your app consists only of static assets that can be deployed to a static host which is fast, easy, and inexpensive (usually free).

Technically speaking: an SSG app is an app where *all* pages are pre-rendered (<Link href="/prerender#partial">`prerender.partial`</Link> is `false`).

For more information see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
