{/* TO-DO/eventually: [#2679 - Rename URL normalization settings](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/2679) */}

By default, URLs are normalized:

```
[vike] HTTP request: /some//path/
[vike] URL normalized from /some//path/ to /some-path
[vike] HTTP redirect /some/path 301
```

You can configure whether URLs are normalized and whether URLs should end with a trailing slash:

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import type { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  // Make URLs end with a trailing slash.
  // For example: /some//path -> /some/path/
  trailingSlash: true,

  // Or completely disable automatic URL normalization.
  // For example keep URL /some//path/
  disableUrlNormalization: true
} satisfies Config
```
