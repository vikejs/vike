By default, URLs are normalized:

```
[vike] HTTP request: /some//path/
[vike] URL normalized from /some//path/ to /some-path
[vike] HTTP redirect /some/path 301
```

You can configure whether URLs are normalized and whether URLs should end with a trailing slash:

```js
// pages/+config.js

export default {
  // Make URLs end with a trailing slash.
  // For example: /some//path -> /some/path/
  trailingSlash: true,

  // Or completely disable automatic URL normalization.
  // For example keep URL /some//path/
  disableUrlNormalization: true
}
```
