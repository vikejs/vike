All we have to do is to install the CSS pre-processor we want and Vite will then use it, see [Vite Docs - CSS pre-processors](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors).

Example:
 - [GitHub > `brillout/vite-plugin-ssr-sass`](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr-sass)
   > vite-plugin-ssr was the [previous name of Vike](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/vike).
