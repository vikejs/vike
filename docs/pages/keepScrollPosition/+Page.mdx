import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

Environment: client  
TypeScript: `boolean | string | string[] | ((pageContext: PageContextClient) => boolean | string | string[])`  
Default value: `false`  

The `keepScrollPosition` setting enables you to control whether the page scrolls to the top upon navigation.

It's commonly used for nested layouts such as tabs, see <Link href="/Layout#nested" />.

For a control on a link-by-link basis, see <Link href="/clientRouting#settings">`<a href="/some-url" keep-scroll-position />`</Link>.


## Basics

By default, the page is scrolled to the top upon navigation. But if you set `keepScrollPosition` to `true` then the page's scroll position is preserved instead.

```js
// pages/product/@id/+config.js

export default {
  // Don't scroll to top when navigating between the pages defined at pages/product/@id/**
  keepScrollPosition: true
}
```

```
pages/product/@id/+config.js
pages/product/@id/pricing/+Page.js
pages/product/@id/reviews/+Page.js
```

```bash
# Scroll is preserved when navigating between:
/product/42
/product/42/pricing
/product/42/reviews

# Scroll is preserved when navigating between:
/product/1337
/product/1337/pricing
/product/1337/reviews
```

Note that the scroll isn't preserved (the page scrolls to the top) if the `@id` parameter differs.

```bash
# Scroll *isn't* preserved when navigating between:
/product/42/pricing
/product/1337/pricing
```

See <Link href="#advanced" /> if this behavior doesn't fit your use case.


## Advanced

You can preserve the scroll position between any arbitrary group of pages (the "scroll group").

```js
// /pages/product/@id/+config.js

export default {
  keepScrollPosition: 'name-of-the-scroll-group'
}
```

```bash
# Scroll is preserved when navigating between:
/product/42/pricing
/product/1337/pricing
```

```js
// /pages/reviews/@id/+config.js

export default {
  keepScrollPosition: 'name-of-the-scroll-group'
}
```

```bash
# Scroll is preserved when navigating between:
/product/42
/reviews/1337
```

If two URLs belong to the same scroll group, then the scroll position is preserved.

You can also programmatically set the scroll group:

```js
// /pages/product/@id/+keepScrollPosition.js
// Environment: client

export default (pageContext, { configDefinedAt }) => {
  console.log(configDefinedAt) // Prints '/pages/product/@id/+keepScrollPosition.js'
  // This is the value Vike sets by default:
  return [configDefinedAt, pageContext.routeParams['id']]
}
```
