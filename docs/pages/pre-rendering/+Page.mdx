## What is pre-rendering?

Pre-rendering means to render the HTML of pages at build-time (when running `$ vike build`).

Without pre-rendering, the HTML of a page is rendered at request-time (when the user goes to that page).

If you pre-render all of your pages, then you no longer need a production server: your app will consist only of static assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images, ...)
that you can deploy to so-called "static hosts" such as <Link href="/github-pages" text="GitHub Pages" />, [Cloudflare Pages](/cloudflare-pages), or [Netlify](/netlify).

If you don't pre-render, then you need a production server in order to be able to dynamically render the HTML of your pages at request-time. (A Node.js production server, or a Node.js-like production environment such as <Link href="/cloudflare" text="Cloudflare Workers" /> or <Link href="/vercel" text="Vercel" />.)

> Tools that pre-render pages are also known as "SSG" (Static-Site Generators).


## Should I pre-render?

In a nutshell: **pre-render your pages whenever you can**.

Because pre-rendering removes the need for a production server and makes deployment very easy and very cheap (mostly free). It's also significantly more performant as the HTML isn't re-generated on every HTTP request.

But **pre-rendering cannot be used for websites with content that changes very frequently**. For example [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com): new content is created every time a user posts something new. Pre-rendering cannot be run again every (milli)second whenever there is new content (Reddit has millions of pages that cannot be re-rendered every (milli)second).

> In theory, it's possible to re-render only the subset of pages that are affected by new content, but it isn't practical (it has been tried before) and we recommend against this practice.

> Technically speaking, what matters is how frequent the HTML content of pages (rendered during SSR) changes, see also:

> - <Link href="/SPA-vs-SSR" />

**Pre-rendering can be used for websites with content that changes only occasionally**. For example, the content of `https://vike.dev` changes only when a maintainer updates the documentation: all pages of `https://vike.dev` can then be pre-rendered again.

> Thanks to pre-rendering, `https://vike.dev` is deployed to <Link href="/github-pages" text="GitHub Pages" />, a static host which is completely free, [easy to use](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/.github/workflows/website.yml), and very performant.


## How to pre-render

To opt into pre-rendering:

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import type { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  prerender: true
} satisfies Config
```

List of options: <Link href="/prerender" />.

Your pages' HTML will be rendered when you run `$ vike build` and the generated HTML files are available at `dist/client/`.

For a page with a parameterized route (e.g. `/movie/@movieId`), you have to use the <Link href="/onBeforePrerenderStart">`onBeforePrerenderStart()` hook</Link> in order to provide the list of URLs that are to be pre-rendered. The `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hook can also be used to accelerate the pre-rendering process.

<PreRenderDynamicRoutes />

By default, all pages are pre-rendered. To pre-render only some pages, use the <Link href="/prerender#partial" text={<><code>partial</code> option</>} /> with <Link href="/prerender#toggle" text={<code>prerender: false</code>} />.

If you pre-render all your pages, then you can use Vike's CLI instead of a server (`$ vike dev` and `$ vike preview`). See linked examples below.

You can programmatically invoke the pre-rendering process, see <Link href="/api#prerender" doNotInferSectionTitle />.

React Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/vite.config.ts' /> (see setting <code>prerender</code> option to `true`)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/hello/+onBeforePrerenderStart.ts' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/star-wars/index/+onBeforePrerenderStart.ts' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/package.json' /> (see Vike CLI usage)

Vue Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/vite.config.ts' /> (see setting <code>prerender</code> option to `true`)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/hello/+onBeforePrerenderStart.ts' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/star-wars/index/+onBeforePrerenderStart.ts' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/package.json' /> (see Vike CLI usage)


## SSG vs SSR vs SPA

This section explains the difference between SSG, SSR, and SPA.

> To decide between SSR and SPA, with a list of pros and cons, see <Link href="/SPA-vs-SSR" />.

> To decide between SSR and SSG, see <Link href="#should-i-pre-render" />

### SSG vs SSR

The only difference between SSG and SSR is *when* the HTML is rendered:
- **SSG**: the HTML of the page is rendered at build-time (when calling `$ vike build`).
- **SSR**: the HTML of the page is rendered at request-time (when the user goes to the page).

> The **client-side code** of pages is loaded and executed in the user's browser and, therefore, always runs at request-time.
>
> If you pre-render all your pages, then there isn't any **server-side code**, because all the "server code" runs at build-time.

> With pre-rendering **it's a misnomer but we still call it "server-side code"** to keep the docs simple. One way to think about it is that pre-rendering means "pre-rendered server-side code".

Essentially, and technically, SSG means SSR + pre-rendering:

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import { Config } from 'vike/types'

// SSG
export default {
  prerender: true,
  ssr: true // optional: `ssr` is true by default
} satisfies Config
```

See also:
- <Link href="/prerender" />
- <Link href="/ssr" />

### SPA

SPA means the page is rendered only on the client-side. In other words, no SSR:

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import { Config } from 'vike/types'

// SPA
export default {
  ssr: false
} satisfies Config
```

But when the user visits an SPA page, the browser still needs an HTML response to kick off client-side rendering. This HTML is usually just an empty shell (it doesn't contain the content of the page). If you want to avoid the need for a production server, you can pre-render this empty shell:

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import { Config } from 'vike/types'

// SPA
export default {
  prerender: true,
  ssr: false
} satisfies Config
```

That's why, the usual practice to create an SPA page is to set `ssr: false` together with `prerender: true`.

> You can also add meta page information (title, description, social image, ...) to the pre-rendered HTML of SPA pages, see <Link href="/head-tags" />.


## Can I use SSG + SPA?

Yes, you can have some pages be SSG while other pages are SPA.

Technically, you still pre-render *all* your pages, it's just that the content of some pages are rendered to HTML (SSG) while the content of others pages aren't rendered to HTML (SPA).

> See explanation at <Link href="#ssg-vs-ssr-vs-spa" />.

For example:

```yaml
pages/+config.js
pages/(marketing)/+config.js
pages/(marketing)/index/+Page.js # SSR
pages/(marketing)/about/+Page.js # SSR
pages/admin-panel/+config.js
pages/admin-panel/index/+Page.js # SPA
```

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  // Pre-render *all* pages
  prerender: true
} satisfies Config
```

```ts
// pages/admin-panel/about/+Page.js

import { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  // SPA
  ssr: false
} satisfies Config
```

```ts
// pages/(marketing)/about/+Page.js

import { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  // SSG
  ssr: true // optional: `ssr` is true by default
} satisfies Config
```
