[Vike][Warning] vike@1.2.3 and vike@1.2.4 loaded which is highly discouraged
```

This warning means you're using two different Vike versions (`vike@1.2.3` and `vike@1.2.4`) at the same time, which is highly discouraged in production.

We recommend having only one Vike version installed. (Or at least make sure to load only one Vike version at a time.)

<Warning>
  **Don't deploy to production if you see this warning**, as you run into the risks of:
   - Insidious issues that are hard to debug.
   - Client-side bloat (unnecessary KBs loaded as multiple Vike versions are loaded).
   - In some cases, security risks.

  That said, you can *temporarily* ignore the warning during development. (For example it's common to link npm packages during development which can lead to multiple `node_modules/vike/` installations with different versions.)
</Warning>

<Contribution>
  Contributions welcome to create a guide for how to dedupe multiple Vike versions.
