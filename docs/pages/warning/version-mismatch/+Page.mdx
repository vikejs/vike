[Vike][Warning] vike@1.2.3 and vike@1.2.4 loaded which is highly discouraged
```

This warning means that two different Vike versions are loaded (`vike@1.2.3` and `vike@1.2.4`).

This **must be avoided in production** â€” use a single Vike version instead.

<Warning>
  **Never deploy to production if you see this warning.** Otherwise, you risk:
   - Bugs that cannot be fixed (Vike internally assumes that only a single Vike version is loaded).
   - Client-side bloat (unnecessary KBs loaded as multiple Vike versions are loaded).
   - It may even lead to security issues.

  That said, **you can temporarily ignore the warning during development**. (For example, it's common to temporarily link npm packages during development which can lead to multiple `node_modules/vike/` installations with different versions.)
</Warning>

<Contribution>
  Contributions welcome to create a guide on how to dedupe multiple Vike versions.
