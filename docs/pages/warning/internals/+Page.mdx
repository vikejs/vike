The following warning means you're accessing a Vike internal that isn't part of Vike's official interface.

```
Using internal pageContext._someInternalProp — https://vike.dev/warning/internals
```

There isn't any guarantee whatsoever — expect breaking changes in any minor version update.

Instead of using internals, reach out to Vike's team to get official support for your use case.

That said, you can suppress the warning by using `dangerouslyUseInternals`:

```js
pageContext._someInternalProp// [!code --]
pageContext.dangerouslyUseInternals._someInternalProp// [!code ++]
```

<Warning>
  If you end up using `dangerouslyUseInternals` then we strongly suggest to reach out to Vike's team.
