The following warning means you're accessing an internal API that isn't part of Vike's official interface.

```
Using internal pageContext._someInternalProp — https://vike.dev/warning/internals
```

Internal interfaces aren't guaranteed to be maintained — expect breaking changes in any minor version update.

The best practice is to reach out to Vike's team to get official support from your use case.

That said, you can also bypass the warning by using `ignoreWarning()`:

```js
pageContext._someInternalProp// [!code --]
pageContext.ignoreWarning('_someInternalProp')// [!code ++]
```
