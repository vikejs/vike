<Warning>
  `*.page*.js` files are deprecated in favor of `+*.js` files, see
  <ul>
    <li><Link href="/Config" /></li>
    <li><Link href="/Page" /></li>
    <li><Link href="/migration/v1-design" /></li>
  </ul>
</Warning>

Environment: browser and server.

A `.page.js` file can export the following:
- `export { Page }` (or `export default`)
- `export { onBeforeRender }`
- <Link href="/exports" />

The `.page.js` file is isomorphic: it can run in the browser as well as in Node.js.

The `.page.js` file is lazy-loaded: it is loaded only when needed which means that if no URL request were to match the page's route then `.page.js` is never loaded in the browser nor in the Node.js process' memory.
