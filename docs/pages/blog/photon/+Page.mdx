We (<Link href="/team">Joël and Rom</Link>) are thrilled to introduce [Photon](https://photonjs.dev) — a next-generation infrastructure for deploying JavaScript servers anywhere (self-hosting, Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, ...) with support for popular server frameworks (Hono, Express.js, Fastify, ...).

It leverages <Link href="/blog/vite-6">Vite's Environment API</Link> — a novel approach enabling first-class integration with deployment providers, delivering unprecedented DX. See <Link href="#features" />.

We believe Photon represents the future of JavaScript deployment, see <Link href="#why-photon" />

> If you use `vike-server` you can easily migrate to Photon. See <Link href="/migration/vike-photon" />.



## Features

#### Server HMR


#### Cloudflare Workers development DX

Huge props to the Vite teams for — it's noval approach.

It's the result of a lot of collaboration between Vite, deployment providers, and frameworks.

And big thanks for @sapphi-red and @hio, James

> To our knowledge, Vike is the second framework that supports developing directly (after React Router, props to them for leading the way)
> This is a major DX improvement for Cloudflare users, and we are thrilled and proud to be the second framework that supports this.

#### Server-side code splitting



## Why Photon?

#### Agnostic

<Link href="/blog/vike-server#sharing-with-other-frameworks">While developing `vike-server` we realized most code is agnostic to Vike</Link>. So we decided to make Vike's deployment infrastructure fully agnostic.

That's what Photon is: it's everything we learned while developing `vike-server`, `vike-cloudflare`, and `vite-plugin-vercel` bundled in one cohesive tool with improved DX and new features — all that completely agnostic to Vike.

Any Vite-based framework can integrate Photon and offer all Photon's features to their users.

#### Collaboration

We believe collaborative infrastructure will eventually outpace non-collaborative ones. For example, the incredible collaboration around Vite has made it very challenging for others to keep up.

We invite and vividly encourage Vite-based frameworks to collaborate on deployment.

#### Nitro

So far, [Nitro](https://nitro.build) has limited success spreading outside of Nuxt, because it isn't flexible enough. Nitro enforces opinions and architectural decisions that it shouldn't. We believe Nitro must (and eventually will) follow Photon's footsepts and become more do-one-thing-do-it-well.

For users, the best oucome is having the choice between Nitro and Photon — with a vibrant and constructive competition between the two.
