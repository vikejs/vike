We are thrilled to unveil [Photon](https://photonjs.dev) — a next-generation infrastructure for deploying JavaScript servers anywhere (self-hosting, Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, ...) with support for any server framework (Hono, Express.js, Fastify, ...).

It leverages <Link href="/blog/vite-6">Vite's Environment API</Link> — a novel approach enabling first-class integration with deployment providers ― which unlocks unprecedented DX for users. See <Link href="#features" />.

We believe Photon represents the future of JavaScript deployment, see <Link href="#why-photon" />


## Features

#### Server HMR


#### Cloudflare Workers development DX

Huge props to the Vite teams for — it's noval approach.

It's the result of a lot of collaboration between Vite, deployment providers, and frameworks.

And big thanks for @sapphi-red and @hio, James

> To our knowledge, Vike is the second framework that supports developing directly (after React Router, props to them for leading the way)
> This is a major DX improvement for Cloudflare users, and we are thrilled and proud to be the second framework that supports this.

#### Server-side code splitting



## Why Photon?

<Link href="/blog/vike-server#sharing-with-other-frameworks">While developing `vike-server` we realized most code is agnostic to Vike</Link>. So we decided to make our deployment integration fully agnostic to Vike. This means any Vite-based framework can integrate Photon and offer their users all Photon's features.

#### Collaboration

We believe collaborative infrastructure eventually outperforms non-collaborative ones. For example, Vite's sheer amount of collaboration has made it very challanging for others to keep up with Vite's features and momentum.

We invite and welcome other Vite-based frameworks to collaborate on deployment infrastructure!

#### Nitro

So far, [Nitro](https://nitro.build) has had only limited success to spread outside of Nuxt. We believe Nitro must (and eventually will) follow Photon's footsepts and become a lot more flexible (imposing less frivolous opinions, and becoming more do-one-thing-do-it-well). The best oucome would be if the users of Vite-based frameworks (including Vike) have the choice between using Nitro and Photon, with a vibrant and constructive competition between Nitro and Photon.
