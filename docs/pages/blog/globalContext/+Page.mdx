We're excited to release (starting from `0.4.229`) a new foundational and first-class feature `globalContext` and related utilities.

- <Link href="/getGlobalContext" />
- <Link href="/pageContext#globalContext">API > `pageContext.globalContext`</Link>
- <Link href="/onCreateGlobalContext" />
- <Link href="/onCreatePageContext" />

These utilities unlocks new use cases and facilities existing ones.

foundational primitive that unlco, most notably:

provides the primitives to build whatever you want.

This double downs on Vike's vision to be a unopinonated core with a set of low-level primitives for unprecedented user freedom.

It's already used by <Link href="/blog/vike-server">`vike-server`</Link> to automatically add the server middlewares of other Vike extensions (such as the upcoming `vike-trpc`, `vike-telefunc`, and `vike-better-auth`).

We also care a lot about zero-config, and that's why everything we released can also be used by Vike extensions.

> We're working towards complete feature parity between Vike extensions and the user-land, so that we can have powerful zero-config <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> that are <Link href="/eject">ejectable</Link>.


## Roadmap

Vike's:
1. `vike-react-zustand` (@nitedani)
2. `vike-react-redux` (@phonzammi)
3. Internal Vike TODOs (@brillout)
4. Open Source Pricing
5. Lot's of polishing small details (e.g. move all, codemods)
6. V1 Release

We also want to work

We're getting close to Vike's first stable release! (Although Vike can clearly already be considered stable given that `0.4.x` has been around since now almost 3 years and still supports the old design `.page.{client,server}.js` design. Needless to say we care about backwards compatibility.)

Also we're making a lot of progress with (@magne4000)
