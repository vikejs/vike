We are thrilled to unveil `globalContext`, available starting from `0.4.229`.

It's a foundational new primitive that unlocks new use cases and facilitates many existing onces.

For example, integrating <Link href="/store">a state management store</Link> is now an even more natural process:

```js
// 
```

It also unlocks feature for Vike extensions. It's already used by <Link href="/blog/vike-server">`vike-server`</Link> to automatically add the server middlewares of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> (for upcoming extensions such as `vike-trpc`, `vike-telefunc`, and `vike-better-auth`).

We've updated Vike's documentation to use `globalContext`, most notably:
 - <Link href="/auth" />
 - <Link href="/store" />
 - <Link href="/markdown#metadata" />



## Vision

This double downs on Vike's vision to be a unopinonated core with low-level primitives, enabling unprecedented user freedom.

<QuoteTeam>Vike gives you confidence you can build whatever you want.</QuoteTeam>

We also care about zero-config, and that's why everything we released can also be used by Vike extensions.

> We're working towards feature parity between Vike extensions and the user-land, enanling powerful zero-config <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>.

> To preserve user freedom, extensions are <Link href="/eject">ejectable</Link>.


## Roadmap

Thanks to `globalContext`, we'll be able to soon release:
- [`vike-react-zustand`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react/pull/171) ([@nitedani](https://github.com/nitedani))
- [`vike-react-redux`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react/pull/161) ([@phonzammi](https://github.com/phonzammi))

We are then going to work on the following:
1. <Link href="/pricing">Open Source Pricing</Link>
1. TypeSafe routing (see [`topic:routing`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Atopic%3Arouting))
1. Improve SSG support (see [`topic:ssg`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Atopic%3Assg))
1. Polish small details (move all export paths to `vike`, e.g. `vike/client/router` to `vike`, powered by automatic codemods)
1. V1 Release

We also want to make a lot of reach out and talk in meetup and conferences and (better) explain our Vision.

So we slowly but surely getting close to Vike's first stable release! (Although Vike can already be considered stable given that `0.4.x` has been around since almost 3 years now.)

Also, we're making a lot of progress with our work on <Link href="/blog/vike-server#sharing-with-other-frameworks">making `vike-server` agnostic</Link> ([@magne4000](https://github.com/magne4000)) so that any Vite-based framework can use it.
