## How can I reach out for help?

### Discord

Use <a href={projectInfo.discordInvite}>Discord</a> to get help from the community. (The Vike team is less active on Discord.)

> There aren't any rules and you can post whatever you want. That said, questions sometime don't get any answers on Discord, so we recommend reading the `#help-guide` channel to increase your chance of receiving valuable assistance. Also, consider giving back by helping others!

### GitHub

Use <a href={projectInfo.githubDiscussions}>GitHub Discussions</a> to get help from the Vike team. (The community is less active on GitHub.)

> Only asks questions related to Vike and follow [these rules](https://brillout.github.io/rules/). If you do then you'll most likely get a response from the Vike team.

### Sponsorship

For extra help and a tight-knit collaboration, [consider sponsoring Vike](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1350).


## How can I reach out for business inquiries?

Contact `brillout`:
 - Per email. (See email address at [github.com/brillout](https://github.com/brillout).)
 - Per PM on Discord. ([Join Vike's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hfHhnJyVg8) => right-click on the picture of `brillout` => `Message`.)

> Don't reach out on Twitter as it has shown to be unreliable.

> Don't privately contact `brillout` for getting help unless you're a sponsor, see <Link href="#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help" doNotInferSectionTitle />


## I can't achieve what I want, can I get help?

Yes, and you can use GitHub Discussions to get help from the Vike team, see <Link href="#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help" doNotInferSectionTitle />

If your issue is caused by Vike, we'll label it a blocker and prioritize fixing it.

In general, Vike <Link href="#can-i-use-vike-to-achieve-what-i-want">aims to be highly flexible</Link> and resolving blockers is a priority for us — ideally by design, or at least by providing help and workarounds.



## Can I use Vike to achieve what I want?

Vike prides itself on being a highly adaptable frontend framework. See for example the <Link href="/use-cases">use case of some of Vike sponsors</Link>.

Vike supports all (common) use cases:
 - <Link href="/ui-frameworks">Any UI framework</Link> (React, Vue, Solid, etc.), <Link href="/integration">any UI tool</Link> (state management, data fetching, CSS framework, etc.).
 - <Link href="/pre-rendering#should-i-pre-render">Without backend</Link>, with <Link href="/server">any JavaScript backend</Link> (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, Adonis, Nest, Deno, Bun, etc.), or <Link href="/integration#non-javascript-backend" doNotInferSectionTitle>with other backends</Link> (Java, Ruby on Rails, PHP, etc.).
 - <Link href="/tools#data-fetching">Any data fetching tool</Link> (REST, RPC, GraphQL, etc.).
 - Optional <Link href="/ssr">Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</Link>, optional <Link href="/pre-rendering">pre-rendering (SSG)</Link>, and optional <Link href="/vercel#vite-plugin-vercel">Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)</Link>.
 - Optional <Link href="/stream">HTML streaming</Link> (with <Link href="/streaming#progressive-rendering">Progressive Rendering</Link>).
 - <Link href="/deploy">Deploy anywhere</Link> (VPS, AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.).

A common source of blockers are bugs; Vike is also unique because we quickly fix bugs and, to this date, [we have been able to fix all bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22bug+%3Aboom%3A%22). We value clean abstractions and correctness, which significantly reduces potential bugs.

Beyond common use cases, Vike has been designed from the ground up to be flexible, so that it can fit special needs. You can use Vike to <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">Build Your Own Framework</Link>.

If you have a use case you aren't sure you can implement with Vike then <Link href="#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">feel free to reach out</Link>.

> In general, Vike aims to be as less blocking as possible. If you run into a blocker then <Link href="#i-can-t-achieve-what-i-want-can-i-get-help">don't hesitate to reach out</Link>.



## How can I contribute/support Vike?

Contributions in forms of [code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1349) or [sponsoring](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1350) are much welcome.


## What are these cryptic JavaScript errors?

Many cryptic errors come from CJS/ESM issues around npm packages that contain invalid JavaScript code, see workaround at <Link href="/broken-npm-package" />.

> We meticulously craft Vike's error messages to be clear and helpful, but error messages from other tools aren't under our control. If any Vike error message isn't clear, let us know, and we'll make it clearer.


## Why is CSS leaked to other pages?

When navigating from one page to another, the CSS of the previous page isn't removed. This means that any CSS loaded by the previous page will also apply to the next page. In other words: the CSS of all previous pages cumulate.

For example:

```jsx
// /pages/terms/+Page.jsx

import './style.css'

export const Page = () => (
  <div id="#terms">
    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <section>
      {/* ... */}
    </section>
  </div>
)
```

```css
/* /pages/terms/style.css */

/* ❌ Bad: the CSS selector `section` applies to all pages. */
section {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
```

Narrow down the CSS selector instead:

```css
/* /pages/terms/style.css */

/* ✅ Good: the CSS selector `#terms section` only applies to the terms page. */
#terms section {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
```

> If you use **Vue** with `.vue` files, then Vue already scopes the CSS for you: the CSS you define in a `.vue` file is guaranteed to apply only to the component defined in that `.vue` file.

> If you use **React** or **Solid**, then we recommend using inline styles and/or a CSS-in-JS library (or Tailwind), while minimizing CSS files. Inline style aren't global and, therefore, aren't leaky.

> **CSS is injected by Vite** in the form of `<style>` tags. If you wonder why Vite doesn't remove the `<style>` tags of the previous page, consider that removing CSS is problematic during the transient state upon page navigation (as it would lead to [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) because there isn't any transaction primitive for DOM manipulation).


## Why are there a lot of HTTP requests in dev?

In development, you may observe a lot of HTTP requests fetching many JavaScript files.
That's because <Link href="/lazy-transpiling">Vite does lazy transpiling</Link>.

While it's true that doing a lot of HTTP requests slows down page load (and optimizing that aspect is on Vite's radar), Vite's lazy transpiling approach enables unparalleled development speed.
