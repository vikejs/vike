With `vite-plugin-ssr` we have the choice between:
 - Server Routing and Client Routing.
 - Filesystem Routing, Route Strings and Route Functions.

## Server Routing or Client Routing?

`vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for both Server-side Routing (full HTML reload upon page navigation) and Client-side Routing (DOM mutations upon page navigation).

<Link href="/server-routing-vs-client-routing" /> helps us choose which one to use.

## React Router / Vue Router

Instead of using React Router or Vue Router, we recommend to only use `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router.

That said, `vite-plugin-ssr` has support for both Vue Router and React Router, see <Link href="/vue-router-and-react-router" />.

## Route Strings & Route Functions

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Filesystem Routing:

```
FILESYSTEM                        URL
pages/index.page.js               /
pages/about.page.js               /about
pages/faq/index.page.js           /faq
pages/movie/@id/index.page.js     /movie/1, /movie/2, /movie/3, ...
```

We can also define so-called "Route Strings" and "Route Functions".

```js
// /pages/product.page.route.js

// This file defines the route of `/pages/product.page.js`

// Route String
export default '/product/@productId'
```

> The parameter `productId` is available at `pageContext.routeParams.productId`.

Route Functions give us full programmatic flexibility to implement advanced routing logic, for example route guards:

```js
// /pages/product/edit.page.route.js

// This file defines the route of `/pages/product/edit.page.js`

import { resolveRoute } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/routing'

export default async (pageContext) => {
  // Ensure that `/product/@id/edit` can be accessed only by admins
  if (!pageContext.user.isAdmin) {
    return false
  }

  // We can use vite-plugin-ssr's Route String resolver
  return resolveRoute('/product/@id/edit', pageContext.urlPathname)
}
```
