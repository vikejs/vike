Using the Vite CLI is deprecated starting from `vike@0.4.213`.

> You can still use it, but you'll see following warning and support for Vite's CLI will be completely removed in the next major release.

Use the Vike CLI instead:

```json5
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // [!code --]
    "dev": "vike dev", // [!code ++]
    "build": "vite build", // [!code --]
    "build": "vike build", // [!code ++]
    "preview": "vite preview", // [!code --]
    "preview": "vike preview", // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

> The Vike CLI is a major milestone towards the `1.0` release and unlocks new fundamental capabilities.

Vike's CLI doesn't have any option: use the `VITE_CONFIG` environment variable instead, see <Link href="/cli" />.

We also recommend using <Link href="/api">Vike's JavaScript API</Link> instead of [Vite's JavaScript API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript), as some features in the near future will only be available when using Vike's JavaScript API.
