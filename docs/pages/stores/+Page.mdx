> **What is a store?**
>
> A store (aka state management) is a tool that helps you manage complex UI state.
>
> Not properly managing UI state is one of the most common cause for buggy user interfaces. A store enables you to get under control even the most complex UI state logic.
>
> A store works by representing state changes as atomic changes to an immutable data structure, enabling a fundamentally more robust state management.

In principle, you can use Vike with any store.
