Environment: server.

`getGlobalContextSync()` and `getGlobalContextAsync()` allow you to access global information about your app.

<Warning>It's a beta feature: expect breaking changes in any minor version update.</Warning>

Most notably the <Link href="/preloading#assets-manifest">assets manifest</Link>.

```js
import {
  getGlobalContextSync,
  /* Or:
  getGlobalContextAsync */
} from 'vike/server'

const globalContext = getGlobalContextSync()
const { assetsManifest } = globalContext
```

> The `globalContext` object also contains internals (they are prefixed with `_`, e.g. `globalContext._viteDevServer`). You should use them only if strictly needed, and if you do then let us know so that we make what you need part of the official API.

> In certain situations, you may need to use `await getGlobalContextAsync()` instead of `getGlobalContextSync()`. The `getGlobalContextSync()` function will let you know when that is the case.
