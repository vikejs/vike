import { Warning, Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

Environment: server.

Access global information about your app, such as <Link href="/preloading#assets-manifest">the assets manifest</Link>.

```js
import { getGlobalContext } from 'vike/server'

const globalContext = await getGlobalContext()

// The assets manifest
console.log(globalContext.assetsManifest)

// Subset of the Vite configuration passed to the runtime. (By default the
// Vite configuration is available only at build-time.)
console.log(globalContext.viteRuntimeInfo)
```

> It only provides information loaded at runtime. To get information loaded at build-time, see <Link href="/getVikeConfig" />.

The `getGlobalContext()` can be called at any time (independently of rendering pages). For example, it can be one of the first functions called upon starting your server, before receving any HTTP request.

> The `globalContext` object also contains internals (they are prefixed with `_`, e.g. `globalContext._viteDevServer`). You should use them only if strictly needed and, if you do, then let us know so that we can add official support for your use case (otherwise you'll expose yourself to breaking changes upon any version update).


## `getGlobalContextAsync()`

```js
import { getGlobalContextAsync } from 'vike/server'
const globalContext = await getGlobalContextAsync(process.env.NODE_ENV==='production')
```

Same as `getGlobalContext()`: for some users `getGlobalContext()` cannot be called early and the solution is to use `getGlobalContextAsync()` instead.

We recommend using `getGlobalContext()` instead: use `getGlobalContextAsync()` only if `getGlobalContext()` throws the following error.

```yaml
# For some users, the following error is thrown when running getGlobalContext()
The global context isn't set yet, use getGlobalContextAsync() instead.
```

The returned `globalContext` is the same as the one returned by `getGlobalContext()`.


## `getGlobalContextSync()`

<Warning>Don't use this: it will soon be deprecated, <Link href="/pageContext">use `pageContext.globalContext`</Link> instead.</Warning>

Same as `getGlobalContext()` but synchronous.
