Using Vike with Storybook should work out of the box.

> By default, <Link href="/vite-plugin">Vike's Vite plugin</Link> isn't loaded when running Storybook.
>
> This is because Storybook is typically used for developing/testing components in isolation — Vike's Vite plugin isn't needed. For that reason, Vike's Vite plugin removes itself when it detects Storybook.
>
> If for some reason you do need Vike's Vite plugin to be loaded, reach out to Vike maintainers.
