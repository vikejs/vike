We recommend the following.

In development:
- Don't set `process.env.NODE_ENV`, or set it to one of the following values: `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`.
- If you don't use Vite's development server, then add Vite's development middleware to your server (as shown in <Link href="/renderPage#usage" />).

In production (and staging):
- Set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to a value different than `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`, for example `'production'` or `'staging'`.
- Don't add Vite's server middleware to your server: it isn't needed in production and would unnecessarily bloat your production server.

> `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a convention to tell libraries whether your app is running in production or development:

> While the convention was introduced by Node.js, it's used by libraries regardless whether you use Node.js or not. That's why we recommend to set `process.env.NODE_ENV` in Edge environments as well.

Vike shows a warning if you don't respect the recommendation above:

```
[Vike][Warning] Vite's development server was instantiated while the environment
is set to be a production environment by `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` which is
contradictory.
```
```
[Vike][Warning] Vite's development server wasn't instantiated while the environment
is set to be a development environment by `process.env.NODE_ENV === undefined` which is
contradictory.
```
