Vike doesn't include an image optimizer (in order to keep Vike lean), instead you can choose an optimizer library, for example:

- [unpic-img](https://unpic.pics/img/)
- [img-optimizer](https://github.com/nitedani/img-optimizer)
- [vite-imagetools](https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/imagetools)
- [vite-plugin-image-presets](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-image-presets)

See also [awesome-vite](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite).
