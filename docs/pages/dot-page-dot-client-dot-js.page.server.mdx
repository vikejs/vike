Environment: browser.

The `.page.client.js` file defines the page's browser-side code.

It represents the entire browser-side code. This means that if we don't create any `.page.client.js` files, then our app has zero browser-side JavaScript.
(Except for Vite's dev code when not in production.)

This also means that we have full control over the browser-side code. Not only can we render/hydrate our pages as we wish, but we can also easily & naturally integrate browser libraries.

```js
// _default.page.client.js

export { onRenderClient }

import { hydrate } from 'some-ui-framework'

async function onRenderClient(pageContext) {
  const { Page } = pageContext
  await hydrate(Page)
}
```

The browser-side is usually about [hydrating](/hydration) the page,
but we can also do partial/island hydration,
only install a couple of JavaScript event handlers,
etc.
