## Can I use Vike in production?

Yes. Many companies, from small startups to large corporations, are successfully using Vike in production in a wide range of diverse scenarios.

For example these Vike sponsors:
 - Alignable (professional social network), with a custom React integration with their Ruby on Rails backend.
   ([Substantially sponsoring `brillout`, the creator of Vike's creator.](https://github.com/AlignableUser#:~:text=www.alignable.com-,Sponsoring,-Achievements))
 - Contra (freelance work market), with a custom React rendering strategy.
   ([Substantially sponsoring `brillout`, the creator of Vike's creator.](https://github.com/contra#:~:text=of%20this%20organization.-,Sponsoring,-Top%20languages))
 - Ecosia (search engine), migrating their entire frontend from Nuxt to Vike with Vue 2.
   (Substantial sponsorship is coming in the next weeks.)
 - Burda (large publishing house), migrating all their online newspapers to a tailored Solid framework built on top of Vike.
   ([Substantially sponsoring `brillout`, the creator of Vike's creator.](https://github.com/BurdaForward#:~:text=People-,Sponsoring,-Top%20languages))

These are just a tiny fraction of the companies using Vike in production.


## Will Vike survive?

Yes. While predicting the future is always difficult, we are confident Vike will stand the test of time. We are a group of passionate developers: for us, working on Vike is the thrill of a liftime and there is no reason for us to stop.

We're making significant progress on being able to financially sustain ourselfes. (Through sponsorships and upcoming innovative open-source business models, without relying on investor money, making Vike financially independent which is paramount in the long-term.) As a company, you can secure Vike's future by [sponsoring](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1350).


## Can I use Vike to achieve what I want?

Vike supports all frontend use cases:
 - <Link href="/deploy">Deploy anywhere</Link> (VPS, AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.).
 - <Link href="/ui-framework">Any UI framework</Link> (React, Vue, Solid, etc.), <Link href="/integration">any UI tool</Link> (state management, data fetching, CSS framework, etc.).
 - <Link href="/pre-rendering#should-i-pre-render">Without backend</Link>, with <Link href="/server">any JavaScript backend</Link> (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, Adonis, Nest, Deno, Bun, etc.), with other backends (Java, Ruby on Rails, etc.).
 - <Link href="/data-fetching-tools">Any data fetching tool</Link> (REST, RPC, GraphQL, etc.).
 - <Link href="/pre-rendering#ssg-vs-ssr">Server-side rendered HTML (SSR)</Link>, <Link href="/pre-rendering">pre-rendered HTML (SSG)</Link>, <Link href="/vercel#vite-plugin-vercel">incremental pre-rendering (ISR)</Link>.

Vike praises itself of being a highly (if not the most) adaptable frontend framework: if you have a use case you believe you cannot achieve with Vike then [let us know](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/discussions).

Also, Vike has been designed from the ground up to be extensible, so that you can <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">Build Your Own Framework</Link>.

As depicted by <Link href="#will-vike-survive">these company's Vike use cases</Link>, Vike is adaptable.


## How can I contribute and/or support?

Contributions in forms of [code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1349) and/or [sponsoring](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1350) are much welcome.


## Can I reach out for help?

Yes, you can reach out on Discord and GitHub. If you use GitHub Discussions, then you'll always get an answer from a Vike team member.

For extra help, the Vike team also offers consulting. Reach out if you want to know more details.


## What are these criptic JavaScript errors?

Many criptic errors come from CJS/ESM issues around npm packages that distribute invalid code, for a solution see <Link href="/broken-npm-package" />.

> There is, unfortunately, not much we can do beyond pushing tools to address CJS/ESM issues which we repeatedly do.


## Why is CSS leaked to other pages?

With <Link href="/client-routing">Client Routing</Link>, when navigating from one page to another, the CSS of the previous page isn't removed. This means that any CSS loaded by the previous page will also apply to the next page. In other words: CSS cumulates upon page navigation.

For example:

```jsx
// /pages/terms/+Page.jsx

import './style.css'

export const Page = () => (
  <div id="#terms">
    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <section>
      {/* ... */}
    </section>
  </div>
)
```

```css
/* /pages/terms/style.css */

/* ❌ Bad: the CSS selector `section` can apply to any page */
section {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
```

Narrow down the CSS selector instead:

```css
/* /pages/terms/style.css */

/* ✅ Good: the CSS selector `#terms section` only applies to our terms page */
#terms section {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
```

> If you use **Vue** with `.vue` files, then Vue already scopes the CSS for you: the CSS you define in a `.vue` file is guaranteed to apply only to the component defined in that `.vue` file.

> If you use **React** or **Solid**, then we recommend using inline styles and/or a CSS-in-JS library (or Tailwind), while minimizing CSS files. Inline style aren't global and, therefore, aren't leaky.

> **CSS is injected by Vite** in the form of `<style>` tags. If you're curious why Vite doesn't remove old `<style>` tags, consider that removing CSS is problematic during the transient state upon page navigation. (It would lead to [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) because there is no transaction primitive for DOM manipulation.) In general, regardless of Vite's behavior, it's a good practice to narrow down CSS selectors.


## Why are there a lot of HTTP requests in dev?

In development, you may observe a lot of HTTP requests fetching a lot JavaScript files.
That's because <Link href="/lazy-transpiling">Vite does lazy transpiling</Link>.

While it's true that doing a lot of HTTP requests slows down page load (and optimizing that aspect is on Vite's radar), Vite's lazy transpiling approach enables unparalleled development speed.
