By default, URLs are normalized:

```
[Vike] HTTP request: /some//path/
[Vike] URL normalized from /some//path/ to /some-path
[Vike] HTTP redirect /some/path 301
```

You can configure whether URLs are normalized and whether URLs should end with a trailing slash:

```js
// vite.config.js

import { ssr } from 'vike/plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    ssr({
      // Make URLs end with a trailing slash.
      // For example: /some//path -> /some/path/
      trailingSlash: true,

      // Or completely disable automatic URL normalization.
      // For example keep URL /some//path/
      disableUrlNormalization: true
    })
  ]
}
```
