## `vike-react`

We recommend using <Link href="/vike-react">`vike-react`</Link> which integrates [React](https://react.dev) in a full-fledged manner.

> <UseBati>`vike-react`</UseBati>

You can also <Link href="#custom-integration">integrate React yourself</Link> if you want full control over the React integration.


## Custom integration

Instead of using <Link href="/vike-react">`vike-react`</Link>, you can implement your own React integration, for full control over the integration of React and React libraries.

<CustomIntegrationWarning list={['vike-react']} />

Official examples:
 - <RepoLink path="/boilerplates/boilerplate-react-ts" /> - Classic integration, using <Link href="/client-routing">Client Routing</Link>.
 - <RepoLink path="/examples/react-minimal" /> - Minimalistic integration, using <Link href="/server-routing">Server Routing</Link>.
 - [`vike-react` source code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react/tree/main/packages/vike-react) - Full-featured integration.
 - <RepoLink path="/examples/render-modes" /> - Integration supporting all <Link href="/render-modes">render modes</Link> (SSR, SPA, and HTML-only).

> For more official examples, see [GitHub > `vikejs/vike` > `examples/`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/tree/main/examples).

Community examples:
 - <Example timestamp="2023.12" repo="luisfloat/vike-island-example" /> - [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) implementation, mixing React and Vue.

## React Server Components

[React Server Components (RSC)](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components) is a new application architecture designed by the React team.

The design can be broken down into three parts:
 -	âœ… RPC (Server Actions)
 -	âœ… Progressive Rendering
 - ðŸš§ Server Components

Vike already supports <Link href="/streaming#progressive-rendering">Progressive Rendering</Link> as well as <Link href="/RPC">RPC</Link>.

> Instead of using [Server Actions using `'use server'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations), we recommend using [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com/) which we believe to be a superior design. That said, a <Link href="/vike-react">`vike-react`</Link> fork can be developed that supports `'use server'`.

Being able to integrate Server Components is work-in-progress.

> While [we are thrilled about Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/188#issuecomment-754815233), we believe it isn't production ready yet.
>
> There are multiple reasons for that. For example, use cases that are essential such as infinite scroll aren't supported yet, [RFC: injectToStream](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/219) is a major blocker, and there doesn't seem to be a clear recommendation (yet) where to set the [`'use client'`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) boundaries (minimizing the number of client components is, counterintuitively, [not always the best strategy](https://twitter.com/cyco130/status/1663515982218838017)).
>
> Also, while the added value of Server Components which is to reduce the size of client-side bundles is definitely a nice-to-have, we believe the slight performance gain isn't worth the added DX complexity. We are hopeful this is going to change as the Server Components design matures: several React frameworks are experimenting and pushing the Server Components design forward. In the meantime, we recommend sticking to the classic and battle tested SSR/SPA/SSG approach (with Vike you can <Link href="/ssr">toggle SSR</Link> and <Link href="/pre-rendering">toggle SSG</Link>).

The most significant added value of the RSC architecture is its novel approach to SSR streaming which unlocks many exciting features around data fetching. Not only does Vike has first-class support for SSR streaming, but it also supports it in a unique way that enables both an easy DX as well as flexibility: you can integrate tools with the SSR stream manually yourself (e.g. using [react-streaming](https://github.com/brillout/react-streaming#readme)), or you can use built-in integrations such as [`vike-react-query`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react/tree/main/packages/vike-react-query#readme) and [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com).

> SSR streaming enables you to define components that can fetch data, while each of these data-fetching components are loaded and rendered independently of each other: the user sees a UI with non-data-fetching parts that are rendered quickly, and data-fetching parts that are rendered as data comes in. This leads to a significantly improved (perceived) page speed. See <Link href="/streaming#progressive-rendering">Progressive Rendering</Link>.
