## `public/`

Vite has built-in support for serving static assets living in the `public/` directory.

For example, if we save a file `public/robots.txt`, then it will be served as-is at `https://example.com/robots.txt`.

Official docs: [Vite - The `public/` Directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory).

## `dist/client/`

After running `$ vite build`, all static assets live in `dist/client/`.

```bash
# The browser-side JavaScript bundle of our page `pages/hello-world.page.js`
dist/client/assets/hello-world.b0c3b30b.js
# Our file `public/robots.txt`
dist/client/robots.txt
```

Note how Vite:
 - Adds the content hash `b0c3b30b` for improved cachability.
 - Copies all files living under `public/` to `dist/client/`.

## Server static middleware

If we use a Node.js production server (i.e. we don't [pre-render](/pre-rendering) our app),
we can alternatively use a server static middleware such as [`express.static()`](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html).

We may want to do this if we have a lot of heavy static assets,
in order to avoid Vite from copying all our large static assets over to `dist/client/` and thus slowing down our build time.
