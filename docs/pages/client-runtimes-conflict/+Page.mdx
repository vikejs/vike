import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

If you get this warning:

```
Client runtime of both Server Routing and Client Routing loaded
```

Then this means that the page loads the client runtime of <Link href="/server-routing">Server Routing</Link> as well as the client runtime of <Link href="/client-routing">Client Routing</Link>.

A given page should *either* use Server Routing *or* Client Routing, never both. Thus only one runtime should be loaded.

The problem is often due to one the following.
 - You configured [Rollup's code splitting](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#chunking-strategy) in a way that includes both runtimes inside a same bundle. For example:
   ```ts
   // vite.config.ts

   import type { UserConfig } from 'vite'

   // This will lead to the warning above. We recommend against this practice: not only because
   // of the above warning but also because, in general, a given page should only load what is
   // strictly needed for that page. (Initial page load speed is usually more critical than
   // subsequent page load speed.)
   const rollupOptions = {
     output: {
       manualChunks(id) {
         if (id.includes('node_modules')) {
           return 'vendor'
         }
       }
     }
   }

   export default { build: { rollupOptions } } satisfies UserConfig
   ```
 - You're importing a utility that is only available to <Link href="/client-routing">Client Routing</Link> such as `prefetch()` or `navigate()`, for a page that uses <Link href="/server-routing">Server Routing</Link>.
   ```ts
   // ❌ Don't import these for pages that use Server Routing
   import { prefetch } from 'vike/client/router'
   import { navigate } from 'vike/client/router'
   ```
   > You'll get a warning:
   > ```
   > You shouldn't `import { something } from 'vike/client/router'` when using
   > Server Routing. The 'vike/client/router' utilities work only with
   > Client Routing. In particular, don't `import { navigate }` nor `import { prefetch }`
   > as they unnecessarily bloat your client-side bundle.
   > ```
   > If you don't get this warning, then the issue is somewhere else.
