For each page, you can choose between:
 - **SSR** (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering): The page is rendered to HTML on the server-side, and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrated</Link> (made interactive) on the client-side.
   > You can also pre-render your SSR pages, see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
 - **SPA**: The page is only rendered on the client-side — the page isn't rendered to HTML.

> You can toggle between SSR and SPA on a per-page basis by using the <Link href="/ssr">`+ssr` setting</Link>.

The main motivation for choosing SSR is that **SSR makes your page's content available to the crawlers of search engines and AI**.

> With SPA, a page is rendered only on the client-side. The HTML of an SPA page is just an empty shell that delivers the page's client-side JavaScript — the HTML doesn't include the page's content. Therefore, **with SPA, the page's content is invisible to the crawlers of search engines and AI** (crawlers navigate your website by reading HTML). For further explanation, see:
> - <Link href="/what-is-SSR-and-SPA#crawlers" />

This means that **SPA isn't an option if your page's content should appear in search engines (e.g. Google) and AI (e.g. ChatGPT)**. You must use SSR.

If SPA is an option, we generally recommend choosing SPA while considering the following trade-offs.

**SPA disadvantage:**
- Slower initial page load, especially on mobile devices.
  > SSR improves performance because the page's content is shown to the user via HTML before any client-side JavaScript loads. Depending on the app, this can make a significant difference, especially on mobile devices where loading and executing JavaScript is significantly slower. For further explanation, see:

**SPA advantages:**
1. Your page's code doesn't run on the server-side. It's easier to write code that runs in only one environment. (E.g. some libraries have issues when run on the server-side.)
1. SPA doesn't require a production server.
   > You can also <Link href="/pre-rendering">pre-render your SSR pages</Link> to remove the need for a production server, but <Link href="/pre-rendering#should-i-pre-render">it doesn't always work</Link>.
1. Reduced backend workload.


## Examples

**SSR** usually makes sense for **content-focused websites** (the primary value is consuming content):
- Social site ([Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), ...)
- Newspaper
- Blog
- Documentation

**SPA** usually makes sense for **interaction-focused apps** (the primary value is functionality):
- To-do list app
- Productivity tool
- Online image editor
- Calendar app

**SPA** usually also makes sense for **private pages**:
- Dashboard interface
- Admin panel
- Company internal application
- User account settings
