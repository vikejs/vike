For each page, you can choose between:
 - **SSR** (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering): The page is rendered to HTML on the server-side, and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrated</Link> (made interactive) on the client-side. (The page is loaded in both Node.js/Bun/Deno and the browser.)
   > You can also pre-render SSR, see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
 - **SPA**: The page is only rendered on the client-side. The page's content isn't rendered to HTML, and the page is loaded only in the browser.

> To toggle between SSR and SPA, see:
> - <Link href="/ssr" />
> - <Link href="/pre-rendering#spa" doNotInferSectionTitle />

The main motivation for choosing SSR is that **SSR makes your page's content available to the crawlers of search engines and AI**.

> With SPA, a page is rendered only on the client-side. The HTML of an SPA page is just an empty shell that delivers the page's client-side JavaScript â€” the HTML doesn't include the page's content. Therefore, **with SPA the page's content is invisible to the crawlers of search engines and AI** (crawlers navigate your website by reading HTML).

This means that **SPA isn't an option if your page's content should appear in search engines (e.g. Google) and AI (e.g. ChatGPT)**. You must use SSR.

If SPA is an option, we generally recommend choosing SPA while considering the following trade-offs:

**SPA Cons:**
- Slower first page load time, especially on mobile devices.
  > SSR improves performance because the page's content is shown to the user via HTML before any client-side JavaScript loads. Depending on the app, this can make a significant difference, especially on mobile devices (where loading and executing JavaScript can be *much* slower than loading HTML).

**SPA Pros:**
1. Your page's code doesn't run in Node.js/Bun/Deno. It's easier to write code that runs in only one environment. (E.g. some libraries have issues when run on the server-side.)
1. SPA doesn't require a production server.
   > You can also <Link href="/pre-rendering">pre-render SSR</Link> to remove the need for a production server, but <Link href="/pre-rendering#should-i-pre-render">it doesn't always work</Link>.
1. Reduced backend workload.


## Examples

**SSR** usually makes sense for **content-focused websites** (the primary value is consuming content):
- Social site ([Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), ...)
- Newspaper
- Blog
- Documentation

**SPA** usually makes sense for **interaction-focused apps** (the primary value is functionality):
- To-do list app
- Productivity tool
- Online image editor
- Calendar app

**SPA** usually also makes sense for **private pages**:
- Dashboard interface
- Admin panel
- Company internal application
- User account settings
