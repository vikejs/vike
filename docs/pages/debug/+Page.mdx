In general, if you run into an issue with Vike, then we recommend <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">reaching out</Link>.

That said, in some situations, you may want to dig into a problem yourself. For example, we may ask you to provide us a minimal reproduction but, sometimes, digging into Vike's source code can be faster than constructing a minimal reproduction. (And reading high-quality source code written by Open Source developers can be fun.)

Also, note the debug logs of Vike and Vite to easily gather insights.


## Dig

The quickest way to dig into Vike is to inject a bunch of `console.log()` inside `node_modules/vike/dist/**/*.js`.

> It may sound scary to dig into foreign source code, but it's sometimes quicker to find the root cause of your problem than treating Vike as a black box. Also:
> - It's more interesting. (Vike's source code is usually well-written and pleasurable to read.)
> - You may end up being able to do a Vike PR solving your problem (while helping the whole community).
>
> We recommend digging not only into Vike, but also into other tools such as Vite (which is very well-written).

> Instead of:
> ```bash
> $ git clone git@github.com:vikejs/vike
> $ cd vike/vike/
> $ pnpm install
> $ pnpm run dev
> $ cd ../../../my-app/
> $ pnpm link ../vike/vike/
> ```
> We recommend to:
> - Browse the source code of `$ git clone git@github.com:vikejs/vike`.
> - For an increased feedback loop, inject `console.log()` directly inside `my-app/node_modules/vike/dist/**/*.js`.


## Vike debug logs

You can use Vike's debug logs to gather insights.

```shell
# Inspect Vike's routing
DEBUG=vike:routing npm run dev
# Inspect HTTP Streaming
DEBUG=vike:stream npm run dev
# Inspect errors
DEBUG=vike:error npm run dev
# Inspect logs
DEBUG=vike:log npm run dev
# Combination
DEBUG=vike:log,vike:error,vike:stream npm run dev
```

> These debug logs allow you to understand how Vike thinks of your app. For example, to figure out why your app returns a `404`, use `vike:routing`.

There are more debug logs but these aren't user-friendly as they are meant for Vike maintainers.

> For more debug logs, add a comment at [#249](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/249).


## Vite debug logs

To enable Vite's debug logs, set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `vite:*`.

```shell
$ DEBUG=vite:* npm run dev
```
