The `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hook is executed during <Link text="pre-rendering" href="/pre-rendering" />
(and only during pre-rendering) and has two purposes:
 - For providing a list of URLs for parameterized routes (e.g. `/movie/1` and `/movie/2` for a route `/movie/@id`).
 - For fetching data in bulk in order to make pre-rendering faster.


## For providing URLs

Most of the time, we use the `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hook in order to provide the URLs of parameterized routes.

```js
// /pages/movie/+route.js
// Environment: Node.js

export default '/movie/@movieId'
```

```js
// /pages/movie/+onBeforePrerenderStart.js
// Environment: Node.js

export { onBeforePrerenderStart }

async function onBeforePrerenderStart() {
  const movies = await Movie.findAll()
  const moviePageURLs = movies.map(movie => '/movie/' + movie.id)
  return moviePageURLs
}
```

> If we don't have any parameterized route,
> then we can pre-render our app without defining any `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hook.

> The `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hooks are called when we run <code>$ vite build</code>.
> (The `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hooks are never called in development.)


## For bulk data fetching

If we have a high number of pages that are to be pre-rendered, then running the command <code>$ vite build</code> may become slow.

We can make it significantly faster by providing the `pageContext` of pages in `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hooks.

```js
// /pages/movie/+route.js
// Environment: Node.js

export default '/movie/@movieId'
```

```js
// /pages/movie/+onBeforePrerenderStart.js
// Environment: Node.js

export { onBeforePrerenderStart }

async function onBeforePrerenderStart() {
  const movies = await Movie.findAll()

  const moviePages = (
    movies
    .map(movie => {
      const url = '/movie/' + movie.id
      const pageProps = { movie }
      const pageContext = { pageProps }
      return {
        url,
        // Because we already provide the `pageContext`, Vike will *not* call
        // the `onBeforeRender()` hook for `url`.
        pageContext
      }
      /* We could also only return `url` and not provide `pageContext`. In that case
       * Vike would call the `onBeforeRender()` hook. But that would be wasteful
       * since we already have all the data of all movies from our `await Movie.findAll()` call.
       * Instead, we provide `pageContext` to make the pre-rendering build step faster.
       */
      // return { url }
    })
  )

  // We can also return URLs that don't match the page's route.
  // That way we can provide the `pageContext` of other pages.
  // Here we provide the `pageContext` of the `/movies` page since
  // we already have the data.
  const movieListPage = {
    url: '/movies', // Note how the URL `/movies` isn't part of the page's route `/movie/@movieId`
    pageContext: {
      pageProps: {
        // We filter out the data we don't need in order to minimize what is sent to the browser.
        // We explain this practice at https://vike.dev/data-fetching
        movieList: movies.map(({id, title}) => ({id, title})
      }
    }
  }

  return [movieListPage, ...moviePages]
}
```

Essentially, the `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hook allows us to prefetch data for multiple pages at once.

> <p><b>Providing <code>pageContext</code> in <code>onBeforePrerenderStart()</code> hooks should only be used for making the pre-rendering build step faster</b> and
> we recommend against using <code>onBeforePrerenderStart()</code> hooks for other purposes.</p>
>
> For example, we should avoid providing additional `pageContext` in `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hooks that wouldn't otherwise exist.
> Instead, we should make sure that our `onBeforeRender()` hooks provide all the `pageContext` we need.
>
> The reason being that `onBeforePrerenderStart()` hooks are never called in development and we should keep our app consistent between development and production.
