import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

By using <Link href="/render" text={<code>throw render()</code>}></Link> or <Link href="/redirect" text={<code>throw redirect()</code>}></Link> you abort the rendering of the current page and render something else instead.

## `throw redirect()` VS `throw render()`

While `throw redirect()` changes the URL, `throw render()` preserves it:
 - If a user goes to `/admin` and `throw redirect('/login')` is called, then the user will see the new URL `/login` in the browser's address bar.
 - If a user goes to `/admin` and `throw render('/login')` is called, then the user keeps seeing the same URL `/admin` in the browser's address bar.

In general, we recommend using `throw render('/login')` instead of `throw redirect('/login')` as it preserves the URL and, therefore, the user's intention. We further explain this techniue at <Link href="/auth#login-flow" />.

## Debug

If `throw redirect()` or `throw render()` doesn't work:
 - **Make sure `throw redirect()` / `throw render()` isn't swallowed.**  
   In developement, check your server logs for the following log. If this log is missing then this means that vite-plugin-ssr didn't receive the `throw redirect()` / `throw render()` exception: some other code is catching and swallowing it.
   ```
   10:00:00 AM [vite-plugin-ssr][request(42)] throw redirect('/some-url') intercepted while
   rendering /some-other-url
   ```
If `throw redirect()` doesn't work:
 - **Make sure to add `pageContext.httpResponse.headers` to the HTTP response.**  
   If you've embedded vite-plugin-ssr into your server using <Link text={<code>renderPage()</code>} href="/renderPage" />, then insepct whether `pageContext.httpResponse.headers` contains the `Location` header and double check that you're correctly adding all the headers defined by `pageContext.httpResponse.headers` to the HTTP response.
