The free program ensures everyone can use Vike.

There are two programs:
1. `Free forever`
2. `Extended free trial`


## Who's eligible?

Your organization is eligible if it has limited financial resources and purchasing a license would be too expensive.

> An organization is eligible if it has **fewer than 10 employees**, while **countries with lower income can have more employees**.

Do you expect more financial resources in the future? Apply for `Extended free trial`; if not, `Free forever`.

> Eligible examples:
> - Startup => `Extended free trial`
> - Open Source (without much revenue) => `Free forever`
> - Amateur sports club => `Free forever`

You can also apply for `Extended free trial` for other reasons (e.g. pending clearance from your company's finance department).

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.
