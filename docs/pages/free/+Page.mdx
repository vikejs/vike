The free program ensures everyone can use Vike.

There are two programs:
- Free forever
- Extended free trial


## Who's eligible?

Your team is eligible if it has limited financial resources: purchasing a license would be too expensive.

> We consider an organization eligible if it has **fewer than 10 employees**, while **countries with lower income can have more employees**.

If you expect more resources in the future, apply for an extended free trial.

> Eligible examples:
> - Startup
> - Open Source (without much revenue)
> - Amateur sports club

You can also apply for an extended free trial for other reasons (e.g. pending clearance from your company's finance department).

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.
