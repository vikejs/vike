<BatiWidget />

> **Requirement**: you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed (or Deno/Bun) which includes the package manager `npm` (you can also use any other package manager).

> The scaffolded app will use Vike extensions such as <UiFrameworkExtension name />. See <Link href="/new/core">vike.dev/new/core</Link> instead if you want to scaffold an app that directly uses Vike core (without any Vike extension).

> This scaffolder is powered by [Bati](https://github.com/vikejs/bati).
