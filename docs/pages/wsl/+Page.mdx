To make HMR work, have a look at the note `Using Vite on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2` in [Vite's `server.watch` documentation](https://vite.dev/config/server-options#server-watch).

If you want to access your server from your LAN, have a look at the note `Accessing the server on WSL2 from your LAN` in [Vite's `server.host` documentation](https://vite.dev/config/server-options#server-host).
