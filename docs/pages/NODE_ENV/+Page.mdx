The `NODE_ENV` environment variable (`process.env.NODE_ENV`) is a <Link href="#see-also">widespread convention</Link> used by tools to distinguish between development and production environments.

In development, make sure `process.env.NODE_ENV` is one of:

```ts
// In development:
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' // ✅
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'dev'         // ✅
process.env.NODE_ENV === ''            // ✅
process.env.NODE_ENV === undefined     // ✅
```

In production, it should be any other value.

> It's important to respect this convention: many tools run erroneously otherwise.

> You can run `$ NODE_ENV='production' node server/index.js` to set a correct `NODE_ENV` value for production.
>
> During build (`$ vike build` and `$ vike prerender`), the `process.env.NODE_ENV` value is automatically set to `'production'`.
