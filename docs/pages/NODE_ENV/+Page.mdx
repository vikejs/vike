Setting `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a <Link href="#see-also">widespread convention</Link> to tell tools whether your app is being run in development or production.

> It's crucial to respect the following convention, otherwise many tools will misbehave (such as React).

In development:

- Make sure `process.env.NODE_ENV` is one of these values: `[undefined, 'development', 'dev', '']`.
- If you use a server, make sure to add Vite's server middleware. (See <Link href="/renderPage#usage" />.)

In production (and staging):

- Make sure `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a value different than `[undefined, 'development', 'dev', '']`.
  > Note that:
  > - Upon starting your server in production, make sure to set `process.env.NODE_ENV`. (E.g. `$ NODE_ENV='production' node server/index.js`.)
  > - Upon building (`$ vike build`), Vite automatically sets `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'production'`.
  > - Upon manually triggering pre-rendering (<Link href="/command-prerender">`$ vike prerender`</Link>), Vike automatically sets `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'production'`.
- If you use a server, make sure you don't add Vite's server middleware: it isn't needed in production and would unnecessarily bloat your production server.
