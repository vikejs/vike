For each page, you can choose between:
 - **SSR** (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering): the page is rendered to HTML on the server-side and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrated</Link> (made interactive) on the client-side. (The page is loaded in both Node.js/Bun/Deno and the browser.)
   > You can also pre-render the HTML at build-time, see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
 - **SPA**: the page is only rendered on the client-side. The page's content isn't rendered to HTML (the page is loaded only in the browser).

Let's now compare both approaches.


## SSR

The main motivation for doing SSR is that **it makes your page's content available to the crawlers of AI and search engines**.

> Crawlers navigate your websites by reading the HTML of pages and by following `<a href="/some-other-page">` found in the HTML. Thus, you should make sure that the content of your pages is rendered to HTML.

In other words, if your page should be integrated by search engines (e.g. Google) and AIs (e.g. ChatGPT) then you most certainly want to SSR your pages.

> Also, SSR improves performance as your page's content is shown the the user before the user's browser load any client-side JavaScript is loaded. Dependening on the app, this can make a significant difference, essentially on mobile (where loading and executing JavaScript can be *much* slower than loading HTML).

For example, websites like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) most always use SSR.

SSR improves mobile performance in the sense that the page's content is rendered to HTML and can already be shown to the user before the browser-side JavaScript even starts loading. ()

> You can also pre-render (aka SSG) if your page's content doesn't updated frequently, see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.


## SPA

With SPA, a page is rendered only on the client-side. This means the HTML of SPA pages is just an empy shell delivering client-side JavaScript â€” the HTML doesn't include the content of the page. The biggest issue is that the **page's content is invisible to the crawlers of AI and search engines** (because crawlers navigate your websites by reading HTML).

This means SPA is only an option if you the page's content doesn't need to appear in search engines (.e.g Google) and AIs.

If SPA is an option, then you choose between SSR and SPA by considering the following pros and cons.

SPA pros:
- Your page's code doesn't need to be able to run in Node.js(/Bun/Deno). For example, SPA is the only option for UI libraries that don't work with SSR.
  > Most libraries nowadays support SSR (or have workarounds).
- SPA doesn't enforce the usage of a production Node.js server: <Link text="SPAs can be easily deployed to a static host" href="/pre-rendering#spa" />.
  > You can also remove the need for a production Node.js server for SSR apps by using pre-rendering.
- Decreased backend workload.

SPA cons:
- Slower first page load time, especially on mobile.

SPA usually makes sense for private pages, for example:
- Admin pages
- Company internal apps
- Account pages

SPA also usually makes sense apps that aren't content-centric but interactive-centric:
- To-do list apps
- Image editor web app
- Calendar app

> *Content-centric*: the value of the app is mostly about content (e.g. a newspaper or a blog).  
> *Interactive-centric*: the value of the app is mostly about interaction (e.g. a to-do list app, an online image editor, or an admin-panel).
