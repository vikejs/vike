For each page, you can choose between:
 - **SSR**: the page is rendered to HTML on the server-side and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrated</Link> (made interactive) on the client-side. (The page is loaded in both Node.js/Bun/Deno and the browser.)
   > You can also pre-render the HTML at build-time, see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
 - **SPA**: the page is only rendered on the client-side. The page's content isn't rendered to HTML (the page is loaded only in the browser).

Let's now compare both approaches.

## SPA

SPA means that the page is loaded & rendered only in the client.

In general, if you page:
 1. doesn't need SEO (e.g. an Admin Panel doesn't need to appear in Google searches), and
 2. mobile performance isn't crucial (e.g. the user is expected to use the Admin Panel on a desktop device).

then SPA is an option.

SPA advantages:
 - Your page's code doesn't need to be able to run in Node.js(/Bun/Deno). For example, SPA is the only option for UI libraries that don't work with SSR.
   > Most libraries nowadays support SSR (or have workarounds).
 - SPA doesn't enforce the usage of a production Node.js server: <Link text="SPAs can be deployed to a static host" href="/pre-rendering#should-i-pre-render" />.
   > You can also remove the need for a production Node.js server for SSR apps by using pre-rendering.
 - Decreased backend workload.

While for certain types of pages, such as an Admin Panel where there is a clear choice in favor of SPA, there often isn't a clear-cut whether we should use SPA or SSR.


## SSR

With <Link href="/server-side-rendering">SSR</Link>, the page is rendered to HTML on the server-side <Link href="/hydration">as well as interactive</Link> on the client-side rendered.

It is the most capable mode as it enables:
 - Improved SEO (e.g. high ranking on Google)
 - Improved mobile performance

For example, social news websites need SSR. (They are interactive while needing both SEO and mobile performance.)

SSR improves mobile performance in the sense that the page's content is rendered to HTML and can already be shown to the user before the browser-side JavaScript even starts loading. (Loading & executing JavaScript is usually very slow on mobile.)

For pages that are not <Link text="content centric" href="/content-vs-interactive" /> (e.g. a to-do list app) and don't need SEO, we can consider [SPA](#spa) instead of SSR.


## Pre-rendering

Pre-rendering means to render the page's HTML at build-time instead of request-time.

We should use pre-rendering whenever we can, as it allows us to deploy our app to a Static Host.

For example, `https://vike.dev` is pre-rendered and deployed to [GitHub Pages](/github-pages).

## SSG

Tools that pre-render pages are also known as "SSG" (Static-Site Generators).

In the context of Vike, we use the terms "SSG" and "pre-rendering" interchangeably.
