For each page, you can choose between:
 - **SSR** (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering): the page is rendered to HTML on the server-side and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrated</Link> (made interactive) on the client-side. (The page is loaded in both Node.js/Bun/Deno and the browser.)
   > You can also pre-render SSR, see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
 - **SPA**: the page is only rendered on the client-side. The page's content isn't rendered to HTML (the page is loaded only in the browser).

The main motivation for SSR is that **SSR makes your page's content available to the crawlers of AI and search engines**.

> With SPA, a page is rendered only on the client-side. This means the HTML of SPA pages is just an empty shell that delivers client-side JavaScript â€” the HTML doesn't include the page's content. This means that **with SPA the page's content is invisible to search engine and AI crawlers** (because crawlers navigate your website by reading HTML).

This means **SPA isn't an option if your page's content should appear in search engines (e.g. Google) and AIs (e.g. ChatGPT)**. You must use SSR.

If SPA then we generally recommend going for SPA, while considering the following pros and cons.

**SPA Cons:**
- Slower first page load time, especially on mobile devices.
  > SSR improves performance because your page's content is shown to the user before any client-side JavaScript is loaded. Depending on the app, this can make a significant difference, especially on mobile devices (where loading and executing JavaScript can be *much* slower than loading HTML).

**SPA Pros:**
1. Your page's code doesn't run in Node.js/Bun/Deno. It's always easier to write code that runs in only one environment (e.g. some libraries have issues when run on the server-side).
1. SPA doesn't require a production Node.js server.
    > You can also <Link href="/pre-rendering">pre-render</Link> SSR to remove the need for a production server but <Link href="/pre-rendering#should-i-pre-render">it doesn't always work</Link>.
1. Reduced backend workload.


## Examples

SSR usually makes sense for content-focused websites (the value of the app is primarily about consuming content), such as:
- Social site ([Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), ...)
- Newspaper
- Blog

SPA usually makes sense for private pages, such as:
- Dashboard interfaces
- Admin panels
- Company internal apps
- User account settings

SPA also works well for apps that are interaction-focused apps (the value of the app is primarily about functionality), such as:
- To-do list app
- Productivity tool
- Online image editor
- Calendar apps
