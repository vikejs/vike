The `onBeforeRoute()` hook provides full control over routing.

It is usually used for [internationalization](/i18n).

We can also use it to [implement a custom router](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/140).

<Warning>For use cases other than i18n, open a GitHub ticket or reach out on Discord: `onBeforeRoute()` is purposely limited but the limitations can be lifted in order to unlock new capabilities.</Warning>

Example:
- <Link href='/examples/i18n/renderer/_default.page.route.js' />
