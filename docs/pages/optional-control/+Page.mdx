A core belief of Vike is what we call *optional control*: you begin with a full-fledged and zero-config setup to quickly get started, while later if/when the need arises you can take control over integration code that was initially hidden from you.

You can for example use <Link href="/vike-react">`vike-react`</Link> to get a quick start like a regular frontend framework such as Next.js while later (progressively) replacing `vike-react` with a fully custom React integration.

If you use Vike without any Vike extension then you have complete control over how tools integrate with Vike and with each other.

{/*
> Vike extensions use the same interface as your Vike app: anything a Vike extension can do, you can do as well.
*/}

With Vike, you get the best of both words: a quick start as well as control if/when you need it.

You can double down on the [Lean Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) methodology:
1. Quickly ship a prototype/[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) in order to quickly get your first users.
1. Quickly get feedback about what users want.
1. As you grow: focus, take control over, and polish features that make your app unique to your users.

{/* Removed the examples because they aren't that convincing. Let's eventually re-introduce examples, once we have more appealing eject use cases.

For example:
- While <Link href="/RPC">RPC</Link> is an excellent choice to quickly get started, you may need GraphQL if you scale to a larger organization.
  > A unique aspect of Vike is that it gives you unprecedented and complete control over the GraphQL integration. (While you can also use Vike extensions such as `vike-react-apollo` to quickly get started with GraphQL.)
- If polishing <Link href="/i18n">i18n</Link> becomes a crucial part of your UX, then you can consider using Vike's low-level hooks for complete control over internationalization.
  > Vike's flexibility is unique as well for i18n.
- If your authentication strategy becomes an important aspect of your business model, then you can eject your authentication Vike extension in order to take full control over the authentication process.
  > Vike extensions such as `vike-authjs` and `vike-lucia` are work-in-progress.
