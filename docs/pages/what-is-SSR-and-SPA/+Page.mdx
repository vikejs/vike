If you're new to modern web development with JavaScript and [React](https://react.dev) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org), you might have heard the terms **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) and **SPA** (Single Page Application) but aren't sure what they mean. This guide explains both concepts and their differences.

> If you're already familiar with SSR and SPA, see <Link href="/SPA-vs-SSR" /> instead.

A unique aspect about JavaScript is that it can run not only inside the browser (browsers support only two languages: [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org)) but also on the server (by using a JavaScript runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

This means that when you define a component like this:

```jsx
function Hello({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
}
```

This JSX code is compiled (by [Vite](https://vite.dev)) to JavaScript and can be run on the client and/or the server.


## SPA (Single Page Application)

**SPA** denotes the practice of rendering components only on the client-side (i.e. in the browser):

```jsx
// Client-side code that renders <Hello name="Alice" />
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

function Hello({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
}

function App() {
  return <Hello name="Alice" />
}

// This runs in the browser
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<App />)
```

The HTML delivered to the browser is minimal and doesn't contain the actual content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My SPA</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Empty container - content will be added by JavaScript -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

**SSR** (**S**erver-**s**ide **r**endering) denotes the practice of rendering components to HTML on the server-side and <Link href="/hydration">hydrating</Link> (making them interactive) on the client-side.

```jsx
// Server-side code that renders <Hello name="Alice" /> to HTML
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'

function Hello({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
}

function App() {
  return <Hello name="Alice" />
}

// This runs on the server
const html = renderToString(<App />)
// html is now: '<h1>Hello Alice</h1>'
```

```jsx
// Client-side code that hydrates the server-rendered HTML
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

function Hello({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
}

function App() {
  return <Hello name="Alice" />
}

// This runs in the browser and makes the HTML interactive
hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />)
```

The HTML delivered to the browser contains the actual content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My SSR App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content is already here when the page loads -->
    <div id="root">
      <h1>Hello Alice</h1>
    </div>
    <script src="/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note how with SSR, the content `<h1>Hello Alice</h1>` is included in the HTML, but with SPA it's missing from the initial HTML.

This is the central functional difference between SSR and SPA: **with SSR the page's content is rendered to HTML whereas with SPA the HTML is just an empty shell**.


## Why Does This Matter?

The difference between SSR and SPA has important implications for your website:

### Search Engines and Crawlers

**Search engines** (like Google) and **social media crawlers** (like Facebook, Twitter) primarily read HTML content. They have limited JavaScript execution capabilities.

- **With SPA**: Search engines see an empty HTML shell. Your content might not be indexed properly, leading to poor SEO.
- **With SSR**: Search engines see the full HTML content immediately, leading to better SEO and social media sharing.

Example of what a search engine crawler sees:

**SPA HTML (poor for SEO):**
```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script src="/app.js"></script>
```

**SSR HTML (good for SEO):**
```html
<div id="root">
  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
  <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
</div>
<script src="/app.js"></script>
```

### Performance

The performance difference between SSR and SPA varies by device:

**Desktop computers** (fast processors, good internet):
- SPA: Usually fine. JavaScript loads and executes quickly.
- SSR: Slightly faster initial load, but difference is minimal.

**Mobile devices** (slower processors, potentially slow internet):
- SPA: Can be significantly slower. Users might see a blank page for several seconds.
- SSR: Much faster initial load. Users see content immediately while JavaScript loads in the background.

**Example timeline:**

*SPA on mobile:*
1. 0s: User visits page
2. 1s: HTML loads (empty)
3. 3s: JavaScript downloads
4. 5s: JavaScript executes and renders content ← User finally sees content

*SSR on mobile:*
1. 0s: User visits page
2. 1s: HTML loads with content ← User sees content immediately
3. 3s: JavaScript downloads
4. 4s: JavaScript hydrates (makes content interactive)

## When to Choose SPA vs SSR

### Choose SPA when:
- Building internal tools or admin panels (SEO not important)
- Creating highly interactive applications (games, editors)
- Your users primarily use desktop devices
- You need offline functionality

### Choose SSR when:
- Building public websites that need SEO
- Creating content-heavy sites (blogs, news, documentation)
- Your users include mobile device users
- You want the fastest possible initial page load

### Best of Both Worlds

With modern frameworks like Vike, you don't have to choose just one approach. You can use:
- **SSR for initial page loads** (fast loading, good SEO)
- **SPA-like navigation** (smooth transitions between pages)

This hybrid approach gives you the benefits of both SSR and SPA.
