If you're new to modern web development, you might have heard the terms **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) and **SPA** (Single Page Application) but aren't sure what they mean. This guide will explain both concepts and their differences.

> If you're alreay familiar with SSR and SPA, see <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" /> instead.

A unique aspect about JavaScript is that it can run not only inside the browser (browsers support only two languages: [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [wasm](https://webassembly.org)) but also on the server (by using a JavaScript runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Bun](https://bun.com), or [Deno](https://deno.com)).

This means that, When you defined a component like this:

```jsx
function Hello({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
}
```

This JSX code is compiled (by [Vite](https://vite.dev)) to JavaScript and can be run on the client and/or the server.


**S**erver-**s**ide **r**endering (SSR) denotes the practice of rendering components to HTML on the server-side.

```js
// TODO: write minimal React code that renders <Hello name="Alice" />
```

```html
// TODO: write minimal but full HTML
<h1>Hello Alice</h1>
```

But that isn't enough to make

-## What is SSR?
-
-Modern UI frameworks,
-such as React or Vue,
-are able to load, execute and render UI source code on the browser-side or server-side, or even both.
-
-The practice of loading & rendering the UI on the browser-side is commonly called *SPA*.

-*Server-side Rendering (SSR)* essentially denotes the practice of loading & rendering the UI not only on the browser-side but also on the server-side.

-## When to use SSR?

With SSR:
1. When someone visits your website, the server runs your application code
2. The server generates the complete HTML with all the content
3. The browser receives ready-to-display HTML
4. JavaScript then "hydrates" the page to make it interactive

With SPA:
1. When someone visites yur website
