If you're new to modern web development with JavaScript and frameworks like [React](https://react.dev) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org), you might have heard the terms **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) and **SPA** (Single Page Application) but aren't sure what they mean.

This guide explains both concepts and their differences.

> If you're already familiar with SSR and SPA and you only want to decide which one to choose, see <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" /> instead.

JavaScript has a unique capability: it can run both in the browser (browsers support only two languages: [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org)) and on the server (using a JavaScript runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

For example:

```jsx
// Welcome.jsx

function Welcome() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
      <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

[Vite](https://vite.dev) compiles this JSX component to JavaScript that can execute on both the client and server.

## SPA (Single Page Application)

**SPA** refers to rendering components exclusively on the client-side (in the browser):

```jsx
// render.js
// Environment: client

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Render <Welcome> on the client-side
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
function App() {
  return <Welcome />
}
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<App />)
```

The HTML sent to the browser contains minimal markup without the actual page content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My SPA</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Empty container: content will be added dynamically by the client-side JavaScript -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/render.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

**SSR** (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering) involves rendering components to HTML on the server and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrating</Link> them (making them interactive) on the client-side.

```jsx
// ssr.js
// Environment: server

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Render <Welcome> to HTML on the server-side
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
const html = renderToString(<Welcome />)
```

```jsx
// hydrate.js
// Environment: client

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Hydrate <Welcome> on the client-side
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <Welcome />)
```

> **Note:** In this example, hydration is unnecessary since `<Welcome>` contains no interactive elements. However, interactive components (e.g., `<Counter>`) require hydration to function properly.

The HTML sent to the browser includes the fully rendered content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My SSR App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content is rendered to HTML -->
    <div id="root">
      <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
      <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
    </div>
    <script src="/hydrate.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Key Difference

The fundamental distinction is clear: **with SSR, the page content is pre-rendered to HTML on the server, whereas with SPA, the HTML remains an empty shell until JavaScript executes in the browser**.

This architectural difference has significant implications for:
 - **SEO and discoverability** (search engines, social media, AI crawlers)
 - **Performance** (particularly on mobile devices and slow connections)


## Crawlers

Web [crawlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)—automated programs used by **search engines** (Google, Bing), **social media platforms** (Instagram, Twitter), and **AI systems** (ChatGPT)—discover and index content by parsing HTML and following links.

**SPA limitation:** Crawlers encounter only empty HTML:

```html
<!-- ❌ Crawlers don't see the page's content -->
<div id="root"></div>
```

**SSR advantage:** Crawlers access complete content:

```html
<!-- ✅ Crawlers see the page's content -->
<div id="root">
  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
  <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
</div>
```

> **Note:** Google's crawler can execute client-side JavaScript, but SSR is still recommended even for Google-only targeting.
>
> <details>
> <summary>Why SSR is still recommended for Google:</summary>
>
> Google's crawler is unique because it can execute client-side JavaScript. This means Google can index the content of SPA apps, but there are several limitations:
>
> - **Unreliable execution**: JavaScript execution may fail or time out.
> - **Delayed indexing**: Google processes JavaScript content in a second wave, which can delay indexing.
> - **Performance impact**: Heavy JavaScript can cause crawling issues.
> - **Future uncertainty**: Google may discontinue JavaScript execution as SSR has become ubiquitous (Google started JavaScript execution at a time when SSR wasn't as widespread as it is today).
>
> For these reasons, SSR remains the recommended approach even if you only target Google.
> </details>


## Performance

SSR delivers superior initial page performance, particularly on mobile devices where JavaScript parsing and execution create significant bottlenecks. SPA users often experience prolonged blank screens while waiting for JavaScript bundles to download and execute.

> **Important:** While initial loads favor SSR, subsequent navigation (via <Link href="/client-routing">client-side routing</Link>) performs equally well in both approaches.

#### Loading timeline comparison (mobile device)

**SPA:**
1. 0s: User visits page
2. 1s: HTML loads (empty)
3. 3s: JavaScript downloads
4. 5s: JavaScript executes and renders content ← *User finally sees content*

**SSR:**
1. 0s: User visits page
2. 1s: HTML loads with content ← *User sees content immediately*
3. 3s: JavaScript downloads
4. 5s: JavaScript hydrates (makes content interactive)

## Understanding the "SPA" Terminology

The term "SPA" (Single Page Application) represents a semantic evolution in web development terminology.

**Original definition:** SPA described applications with genuinely single-page interfaces—like [Gmail](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/what-does-ajax-even-stand-for/)—where navigation occurs entirely within one URL without traditional page transitions.

**Modern usage:** The industry now uses "SPA" as shorthand for "client-side rendered," encompassing any application that renders content in the browser, regardless of having multiple routes or pages. While technically imprecise, this broader definition has achieved universal adoption.

> **Terminology note:** CSR (Client-Side Rendering) would be more technically accurate, but "SPA" dominates industry discourse. Vike's documentation follows this established convention for clarity and consistency.
