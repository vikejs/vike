If you're new to modern web development with JavaScript and UI frameworks like [React](https://react.dev) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org), you might have heard the terms **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) and **SPA** (Single Page Application) but aren't sure what they mean.

This guide explains both concepts and their differences.

> If you're already familiar with SSR and SPA and you only want to decide which one to choose, see <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" /> instead.

JavaScript has a unique capability: it can run both in the browser (browsers support only two languages: [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org)) and on the server (using a JavaScript runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

For example:

```jsx
// Welcome.jsx

function Welcome() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
      <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

This JSX component is compiled (by [Vite](https://vite.dev)) to JavaScript and can run on both the client and the server.

**SPA** refers to the practice of rendering components only on the client-side (i.e., in the browser):

```jsx
// render.js
// Environment: client

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Render <Welcome> on the client-side
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
function App() {
  return <Welcome />
}
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<App />)
```

The HTML delivered to the browser is minimal and doesn't contain the actual content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My SPA</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Empty container: content will be added dynamically by the client-side JavaScript -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/render.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**SSR** (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering) refers to rendering components to HTML on the server-side and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrating</Link> them (making them interactive) on the client-side.

```jsx
// ssr.js
// Environment: server

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Render <Welcome> to HTML on the server-side
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
const html = renderToString(<Welcome />)
```

```jsx
// hydrate.js
// Environment: client

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Hydrate <Welcome> on the client-side
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <Welcome />)
```

> In this example, hydration is unnecessary because `<Welcome>` isn't interactive, but note that interactive components (e.g., `<Counter>`) require hydration.

The HTML delivered to the browser contains the actual content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My SSR App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content is rendered to HTML -->
    <div id="root">
      <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
      <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
    </div>
    <script src="/hydrate.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice that with SSR, the content of `<Welcome>` is included in the HTML, while with SPA it's missing.

This is the key difference between SSR and SPA: **with SSR, the page's content is rendered to HTML, whereas with SPA, the HTML is just an empty shell**.

This difference has important implications for:
 - **Crawlers** (search engines, social media, and AI)
 - **Performance** (especially on mobile devices)


## Crawlers

[Crawlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) from **search engines** (e.g., Google), **social media platforms** (e.g., Instagram, Twitter), and **AI systems** (e.g., ChatGPT) navigate your website by reading the HTML of your pages and following `<a href="/some-other-page">` links.

With SPA, crawlers only see empty HTML:

```html
<!-- ❌ Crawlers don't see the page's content -->
<div id="root"></div>
```

With SSR:

```html
<!-- ✅ Crawlers see the page's content -->
<div id="root">
  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
  <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
</div>
```

> Google's crawler can execute client-side JavaScript, but we still recommend using SSR even if you only target Google.

> <summary>Why SSR is still recommended for Google:</summary>
>
> Google's crawler is unique because it can execute client-side JavaScript. This means Google can index the content of SPA apps, but there are several limitations:
>
> - **Unreliable execution**: JavaScript execution may fail or time out.
> - **Delayed indexing**: Google processes JavaScript content in a second wave, which can delay indexing.
> - **Performance impact**: Heavy JavaScript can cause crawling issues.
> - **Future uncertainty**: Google may discontinue JavaScript execution as SSR has become ubiquitous (Google started JavaScript execution at a time when SSR wasn't as widespread as it is today).
>
> For these reasons, SSR remains the recommended approach even if you only target Google.

## Performance

SSR provides faster initial page loads, especially on mobile devices where JavaScript loading and execution are significantly slower. With SPA, users may see a blank page for several seconds while JavaScript loads and executes.

> **Note:** Subsequent page navigation (also known as <Link href="/client-routing">client-side navigation</Link>) is equally fast between SSR and SPA.

#### Loading timeline comparison (mobile device)

**SPA:**
1. 0s: User visits page
2. 1s: HTML loads (empty)
3. 3s: JavaScript downloads
4. 5s: JavaScript executes and renders content ← *User finally sees content*

**SSR:**
1. 0s: User visits page
2. 1s: HTML loads with content ← *User sees content immediately*
3. 3s: JavaScript downloads
4. 5s: JavaScript hydrates (makes content interactive)

## SPA is a misnomer

The term "SPA" (Single Page Application) is technically a misnomer in modern web development.

**Historically**, SPA referred to applications that truly had only one page—like [Gmail](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/what-does-ajax-even-stand-for/)—where you never navigate to different URLs and everything happens within a single interface.

**Today**, "SPA" is commonly used to mean "not SSR"—referring to any client-side rendered application, even those with multiple pages and different URLs. While technically incorrect, this usage has become widely accepted.

> **Note:** A more accurate term would be CSR (Client-Side Rendering), but "SPA" is the established terminology in the web development community. That's why we use "SPA" throughout Vike's documentation.
