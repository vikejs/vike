If you're new to modern web development with JavaScript and UI frameworks like [React](https://react.dev) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org), you might have heard the terms **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) and **SPA** (Single Page Application) but aren't sure what they mean.

This guide explains both concepts and their differences.

> If you're already familiar with SSR and SPA and you only want to decide which one to choose, see <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" /> instead.

JavaScript has a unique capability: it can run both in the browser (browsers support only two languages: [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org)) and on the server (using a JavaScript runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

For example:

```jsx
// Welcome.jsx

function Welcome() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
      <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

[Vite](https://vite.dev) compiles this JSX component to JavaScript that can execute on both the client and server.

**SPA** refers to rendering components exclusively on the client-side (in the browser):

```jsx
// render.js
// Environment: client

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Render <Welcome> on the client-side
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Welcome />)
```

The HTML sent to the browser is just an empty shell that delivers the client-side JavaScript:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Empty container: content will be added dynamically by render.js -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/render.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**SSR** (**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering) involves rendering components to HTML on the server and then <Link href="/hydration">hydrating</Link> them (making them interactive) on the client-side.

```jsx
// ssr.js
// Environment: server

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Render <Welcome> to HTML on the server-side
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
const html = renderToString(<Welcome />)
```

```jsx
// hydrate.js
// Environment: client

import { Welcome } from './Welcome'

// Hydrate <Welcome> on the client-side
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <Welcome />)
```

> In this example, hydration is unnecessary since `<Welcome>` isn't interactive. However, interactive components (e.g. [`<Counter>`](https://gist.github.com/brillout/16ee742e9c58536a620441c76a713173)) require hydration to function properly.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Content is rendered to HTML -->
    <div id="root">
      <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
      <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
    </div>
    <script src="/hydrate.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice that with SSR, the content of `<Welcome>` is included in the HTML, while with SPA it's missing.

This is the key difference between SSR and SPA: **with SSR, the page's content is included in the HTML, whereas with SPA, the HTML is just an empty shell**.

This difference has important implications for:
- **Crawlers** (search engines, social sites, AI)
- **Performance** (particularly on mobile devices or slow connections)


## Crawlers

The [crawlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) of **search engines** (e.g. Google, Bing), **social sites** (e.g. Instagram, Twitter), and **AI** (e.g. ChatGPT) navigate your website by reading the HTML of your pages and following `<a href="/some-other-page">` links.

With *SPA*, crawlers only see empty HTML:

```html
<!-- ❌ Crawlers don't see the page's content -->
<div id="root"></div>
```

With *SSR*:

```html
<!-- ✅ Crawlers see the page's content -->
<div id="root">
  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
  <p>This is an article about web development...</p>
</div>
```

> Google's crawler can execute client-side JavaScript, but we still recommend using SSR even if you only target Google.
>
> <details>
> <summary>Why SSR is still recommended for Google:</summary>
>
> Google's crawler is unique because it can execute client-side JavaScript. This means Google can index the content of SPA apps, but there are several limitations:
>
> - **Unreliable execution**: JavaScript execution may fail or time out.
> - **Delayed indexing**: Google processes JavaScript content in a second wave, which can delay indexing.
> - **Performance impact**: Heavy JavaScript can cause crawling issues.
> - **Future uncertainty**: Google may discontinue JavaScript execution as SSR has become ubiquitous (Google started JavaScript execution at a time when SSR wasn't as widespread as it is today).
>
> For these reasons, SSR remains the recommended approach even if you only target Google.
> </details>


## Performance

SSR provides faster initial page load, especially on mobile devices where JavaScript loading and execution is significantly slower. With SPA, users may see a blank page for several seconds while JavaScript loads and executes.

> **Note:** Subsequent page navigation (also known as <Link href="/client-routing">client-side navigation</Link>) is equally fast between SSR and SPA.

#### Initial page load comparison (mobile device)

| Time | SPA | SSR |
|------|-----|-----|
| **0s** | User visits page | User visits page |
| **1s** | HTML loads (empty) | HTML loads with content <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>← *User sees content*</span> |
| **3s** | JavaScript downloads | JavaScript downloads |
| **5s** | JavaScript executes and renders content <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>← *User finally sees content*</span> | JavaScript hydrates (makes content interactive) |


## SPA is a misnomer

The term SPA (**S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication) has become a misnomer in modern web development.

**Historically**, SPA referred to applications that truly had only one page — like [Gmail](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/what-does-ajax-even-stand-for/) — where you never navigate to different URLs and everything happens within a single interface.

**Today**, SPA is commonly used to mean **not SSR** — referring to any client-side rendered application, even those with multiple pages and different URLs. While technically incorrect, this usage has become widely accepted.

> **Note:** A more accurate term would be CSR (Client-Side Rendering), but "SPA" is the established terminology in the web development community. That's why we use the term SPA in Vike's documentation.
