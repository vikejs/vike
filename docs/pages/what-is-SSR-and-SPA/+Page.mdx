If you're new to modern web development with JavaScript and [React](https://react.dev) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org), you might have heard the terms **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) and **SPA** (Single Page Application) but aren't sure what they mean. This guide explains both concepts and their differences.

> If you're alreay familiar with SSR and SPA, see <Link href="/SSR-vs-SPA" /> instead.

A unique aspect about JavaScript is that it can run not only inside the browser (browsers support only two languages: [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [wasm](https://webassembly.org)) but also on the server (by using a JavaScript runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

This means that, When you defined a component like this:

```jsx
function Hello({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
}
```

This JSX code is compiled (by [Vite](https://vite.dev)) to JavaScript and can be run on the client and/or the server.


**SPA** denotes the practice of rendering components only on the client-side (i.e. in the browser):

```js
// TODO: write minimal React code that renders <Hello name="Alice" /> on the client-side
```
```html
// TODO: write minimal but full HTML that delivers the JavaScript code above
```

**SSR* (**S**erver-**s**ide **r**endering) denotes the practice of rendering components to HTML on the server-side and <Link href="/hydration">hydrating</Link> (made interactive) them on the client-side .

```js
// TODO: write minimal React code that renders <Hello name="Alice" /> on the server-side
```
```js
// TODO: write minimal React code that hydrates <Hello name="Alice" /> on the client-side
```

```html
// TODO: write minimal but full HTML
<h1>Hello Alice</h1>
```

Note how `<h1>Hello Alice</h1>`, with SSR, the content `<h1>Hello Alice</h1>` is included in the HTML but missing with SPA

This is the central functional difference between SSR and SPA: with SSR the page's content is rendered to HTML whereas with SPA the HTML is just an empty shell.
