In production, the server build (which lives at `dist/server/`) is automagically loaded.

But, in some (rare) situations, the trick used by Vike doesn't work. In that case, we have to manually load the files living at `dist/server/`. We do this by importing `dist/server/importBuild.cjs`:

```ts ts-only
// server.ts

// We load the server build living at dist/server/
import './path/to/dist/server/importBuild.cjs'

// Your server code, e.g. Express.js code, Vercel serverless function, Cloudflare Worker, ...
import { renderPage } from 'vike/server'
// ...
```

If you use [`vite.config.js > build.outDir`](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-outdir), then replace the path `./path/to/dist/server/importBuild.cjs` with the path to your custom build directory `./path/to/${build.outDir}/server/importBuild.cjs`.

> See [#403](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/403) if you're curious about the trick Vike uses to automagically import `dist/server/` files.
