The file extensions `.server.js` and `.client.js` enable you to ensure in what environment a file is loaded.

```js
// /server/database/credentials.server.js

// This should *never* be imported by client-side code. We use .server.js to guarentee that.
export deault {
  password: 'WLa!9HW?E10a'
}
```

```js
// /utils/someHeavyCode.server.js

// Thanks to `.server.js`, this file is guarenteed to never load on the client-side: we
// have the assurance this heavy file won't bloat the size of our client bundles.

function someHeavyCode() {
  // A *lot* of code
}
```

```js
// /utils/someClientCode.client.js

// This code only works in the browser; we use .client.js to ensure this file is
// never loaded on the server-side.

window.onclick = () => {
  // ...
}
```
