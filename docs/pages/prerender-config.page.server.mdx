> See <Link href="/pre-rendering" /> for an overview of how to pre-render our app.

By default, pre-rendering is disabled. To enable it:

```js
// vite.config.js

import { ssr } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    ssr({
      // Use the default pre-render config:
      prerender: true
      // Deviate from the default pre-render config:
      prerender: {
        partial?: boolean
        noExtraDir?: boolean
        parallel?: boolean | number
        disableAutoRun?: boolean
      }
    })
  ]
}
```


## `partial`

Optional, default value: `false`.

Allow only some of our pages to be pre-rendered.

This setting doesn't affect the pre-rendering process: it merely suppresses the warnings when some of our pages cannot be pre-rendered.

> As explained in <Link href="/pre-rendering" />, if we don't pre-render all pages, then we need a production server. By using <Link text={<code>vite-plugin-vercel</code>} href="/vercel#vite-plugin-vercel" />, we can still statically deploy our pre-rendered pages while using a production server for our non-pre-rendered pages.

> `vite-plugin-ssr` shows a warning that a page cannot be pre-rendered, when the page has a parameterized route (e.g. a  <Link text="Route String" href="/route-string" /> `/movie/@movieId`, or a <Link text="Route Function" href="/route-function" />), and there isn't any <Link text={<><code>prerender()</code> hook</>} href="prerender" /> that provides at least one URL matching the page's route (e.g. `/movie/42`).


## `noExtraDir`

Optional, default value: `false`.

Don't create a new directory for each HTML file.

For example, generate `dist/client/about.html` instead of `dist/client/about/index.html`.

> Generting a directory for each HTML file is the most reliable way for telling Static Hosts the static URL of each static HTML.
> But some static hosts prefer the other way.


## `parallel`

Optional, default value: [`os.cpus().length`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_cpus).

Number of concurrent pre-render jobs.

Set to `false` (or `1`) to disable concurrency.

> The default value is the fastest, but it may induce high spikes of memory usage.
>
> Disable concurrency if:
> - You encounter `JavaScript heap out of memory` errors.
> - If pre-rendering takes an abnormal high amount of time. (Caused by the very slow process of memory swapping that kicks-in when memory starts to saturates).


## `disableAutoRun`

Optional, default value: `false`.

Disable the automatic initiation of the pre-rendering process when running `$ vite build`.

Use this if you want to programmatically initiate the pre-rendering process instead.
