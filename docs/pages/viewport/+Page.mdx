The `viewport` setting sets [the page's shown width on mobile/tablet devices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag).

On mobile/tablet devices, you have the choice between two viewport settings:
 - Responsive: the page's width corresponds to the device width's (it isn't zoomed out).
 - [Zoomed out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14775195/is-the-viewport-meta-tag-really-necessary/14775557#14775557).

By default, Vike assumes your page to be responsive.

> In other words, by default Vike injects the following `<meta name="viewport">` tag:
>
> ```html
> <head>
>   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
> </head>
> ```

If your page isn't responsive, then we recommend setting the initial page width shown to the user:

```ts
// pages/admin-panel/+config.ts

import type { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  // The admin panel pages start to look good starting from a width of 1200px
  viewport: 1200
} satisfies Config
```

> If your page looks and works well only starting from 1200px then we recommend setting the value to `1200`, so that the width shown to the user is 1200px (the virtual width), even on a mobile device with a real physical width of 600px: the browser will then zoom out the page by a factor of `2x` in order to match 1200px.
>
> The user will be able to manually change the viewport size with pinch gestures.

> It adds
> [`<meta name="viewport">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag)
> to `<head>`.
>
> ```html
> <head>
>   <meta name="viewport" content="width=1200" />
> </head>
> ```

> The `viewport` setting (and the `<meta name="viewport">` tag in general) has an effect only on mobile/tablet devices: it's ignored on desktop devices.

You can also set any arbitrary `<meta name="viewport">` tag:

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import type { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  // Don't inject any `<meta name="viewport">` tag
  viewport: null
} satisfies Config
```
```ts
// pages/+Head.ts

// Same as Vike's default but adding `user-scalable=no` which makes sense for
// highly interactive apps such as games.
export default () => <>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no" />
</>
```

> If there isn't any `<meta name="viewport">` tag, then the browser will fallback to its default. We don't recommend this (it's unpredictable) and instead consider always setting a `<meta name="viewport">` tag.
