We recommend using [Photon](https://photonjs.dev) for a seamless and full-fledged [Vercel](https://vercel.com) integration, including [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/incremental-static-regeneration/overview).

The entire documentation for using Vercel with Photon is contained on this page and <Link href="/vike-photon"/>.

> Alternatively, for more control, you can <Link href="#manual-integration">manually integrate Vercel</Link> instead of using Photon.

<VikePhotonBetaWarning />


## Get started

> If you <Link href="/pre-rendering#partial">pre-render your pages only partially</Link>, you can also use <Link href="/vike-photon" /> to statically deploy your pre-rendered pages while dynamically serving your SSR pages.

### New app

<UseScaffolder>Vercel with Photon</UseScaffolder>

### Add to existing app

> If you're using `vike-server` then  <Link href="/migration/vike-photon">migrate to `vike-photon`</Link>.

import type { Config } from 'vike/types'
import vikePhoton from 'vike-photon/config'// [!code ++]

export default {
  extends: [vikePhoton]// [!code ++]
} satisfies Config
```

<PhotonAutoLoad pkg="vercel" />

> Under the hood, `@photonjs/vercel` uses Vercel's [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3).

#### 2. Server (optional)

<PhotonBuiltInServer />


## ISR

Vike supports [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/incremental-static-regeneration/overview) when using Photon.

```ts
// pages/some-route/+config.ts

import type { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  // Options
  isr: {
    // Expiration time (in seconds) before the cached asset is re-generated
    expiration: 30
  },
} satisfies Config
```

## Deployment

You can deploy your app using either Vercel's CLI or Vercel's Git integration.

### CLI

Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli), then run the `vercel` command.
The CLI will guide you through the necessary steps.

### Git

See the [official documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/git#deploying-a-git-repository).


## Manual integration

### API Route

A simple way to integrate Vercel is to create a Vercel API Route `api/ssr.js` that server-side renders your app.

Example:
 - <Example timestamp="2024.03" repo="brillout/vike-with-vercel" />
<Warning>Make sure to properly set `OUTPUT DIRECTORY` in your Vercel dashboard, see the example's `README.md` instructions.</Warning>

> Using a Vercel API Route is a sturdy way to deploy to Vercel, as API Routes is a core Vercel feature: it's here to stay and, most importantly, stable. (Whereas Vercel's Build Output API is a moving target with occasional breaking changes.) Once you've set the server-side rendering API Route, you can expect it to work for the foreseeable future.


### Build Output API

For maximum flexibility and configuration options, you can use the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) instead of an API route.

Example:
 - <Example timestamp="2022.07" repo="brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel_build-output-api" />
   > vite-plugin-ssr was the [previous name of Vike](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/vike).


### API Routes with development

Vercel API Routes only work in production on Vercel's platform. This means, you may need to re-create your API routes integration for development.

For example, you typically need to integrate your data layer twice:
 1. Using Vercel's API Routes, for Vercel deployment.
 1. Using a local server (e.g. Express.js), for development.

This is usually easy to achieve as most data layer tools integrate using a single HTTP endpoint. For example:
 - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) integrates over a single HTTP endpoint `/graphql`.
 - [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com/) integrates over a single HTTP endpoint `/_telefunc`.
 - [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) integrates over a single HTTP endpoint as well.

In other words, you can add a data layer by:
 - Creating a new Vercel API Route, integrating that single endpoint.
 - Creating a new route to your local development server (e.g. Express.js), integrating that single endpoint.
