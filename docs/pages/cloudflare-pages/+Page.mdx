Instead of using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), we recommend <Link href="/cloudflare">using `vike-photon`</Link> also for deploying static websites (aka <Link href="/pre-rendering#ssg">SSG / pre-rendered apps</Link>).

> Cloudflare Pages is [being deprecated](https://blog.cloudflare.com/full-stack-development-on-cloudflare-workers/#start-with-workers) — you can still use it but the official recommendation is to start new projects with Cloudflare Workers instead.
>
> The `vike-photon` extension uses [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) — it doesn't use Cloudflare Pages. (Cloudflare Workers recently added support for deploying static assets.)

> Cloudflare and `vike-photon` can also be used to deploy <Link href="/ssr">SSR</Link>. See <Link href="/cloudflare" />.
