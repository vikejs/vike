Instead of using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), we recommend using <Link href="/vike-photon">`vike-photon`</Link> for deploying static websites (aka <Link href="/pre-rendering#ssg">SSG / pre-rendered apps</Link>) — see <Link href="/cloudflare" />.

> Cloudflare Pages is [being deprecated](https://blog.cloudflare.com/full-stack-development-on-cloudflare-workers/#start-with-workers) — you can still use it but the official recommendation is to start new projects with Cloudflare Workers instead.

> The `vike-photon` extension can be used to deploy static websites as well as <Link href="/ssr">SSR</Link>. It always uses [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) — never Cloudflare Pages — since Cloudflare Workers recently added support for serving static assets.
