import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

Default: `true`.

When `includeAssetsImportedByServer` is `true`, then static assets (CSS, images, ...) imported by server-only code are included in the client production build (`/dist/client/assets/`).

It's `true` by default and, in principle, there isn't any reason to disable it. You can however disable it:

```ts
// pages/+config.ts

import type { Config } from 'vike/types'

export default {
  includeAssetsImportedByServer: false
} satisfies Config
```
