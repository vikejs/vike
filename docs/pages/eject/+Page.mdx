The [eject package](https://github.com/snake-py/eject) enables you to take control of Vike extensions.

It moves the code of the extension from `/node_modules/vike-some-extension/` to your Git repository at `/ejected/vike-some-extension/`. This means you can then fully modify the code of `vike-some-extension`.

> The ejected code at `/ejected/vike-some-extension` is the built JavaScript, but there is [work-in-progress](https://github.com/snake-py/eject/issues/4) for copying the original source code (e.g. TypeScript) from the extension's Git repository (instead of copying `/node_modules/vike-some-extension/`).

> Eject also has limited support for other npm packages; Vike extensions are guaranteed to be fully supported.

## When to eject?

In general, before considering ejection, we recommend reaching out to the maintainer of the Vike extension and to consider making a Pull Request.

Only eject as a last resort &mdash; when it's clear that it's the only option.
