A common practice with Vike is ejecting extensions: you remove the extension, copy its source code, then customize the integration.

> Vike extensions use the same API as Vike users.

> Thanks to Vike's powerful hooks, extensions are usually small — ejecting them is easy.

You can do this process manually, or you can use the `eject` package to automatically copy extension code.

## Package `eject`

The [`eject` package](https://github.com/snake-py/eject) automatically copies the code of any npm package, including Vike extensions.

It moves the code from `/node_modules/vike-awesome-extension/` to your Git repository at `/ejected/vike-awesome-extension/` — you can then fully customize the code.

> The ejected code at `/ejected/vike-awesome-extension` is the built JavaScript, but there is [work-in-progress](https://github.com/snake-py/eject/issues/4) for copying the original source code (e.g. TypeScript from the Git repository instead of copying `/node_modules/vike-awesome-extension/`).

## When to eject?

We recommend ejecting only as a last resort: only when it becomes clear that ejecting is the only option left for resolving your issue.

In particular, before considering ejecting, create a new issue on GitHub. The maintainer of the Vike extension will most likely be able to help you, so that you don't have to eject. You can also create a Pull Request (which is still better than ejecting because you'll keep using a well-maintained integration, and also because you'll help the community).
