We generally recommend using Vike with an RPC tool. See <Link href="/data-fetching" />.

> **What is RPC?**
>
> [**R**emote **P**rocedure **C**all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (RPC, aka Server Actions) enables the frontend to seamlessly call backend functions, see in-depth explanation [here](https://telefunc.com/RPC).
>
> It's an increasingly popular data-fetching technique, used instead of GraphQL and REST. You can use both RPC and GraphQL/RPC in the same app, but that's rarely necessary.

Common RPC tools:

- [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com)
  > Telefunc was created by the Vike team.

  > There is work-in-progress to be able to use Telefunc to fetch initial data (instead of using `+data`), see [Telefunc > #102](https://github.com/brillout/telefunc/issues/102).
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
  > Similar to Telefunc:
  >  - Con: Telefunc is simpler.
  >  - Pro: supports real-time data using websockets.
