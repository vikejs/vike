# What is SSR and SPA?

If you're new to modern web development, you might have heard the terms **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) and **SPA** (Single Page Application) but aren't sure what they mean or when to use them. This guide will explain both concepts in simple terms and help you understand their differences.

## What is SPA?

**SPA** stands for **Single Page Application**. Despite the name, SPAs can have multiple pages - the "single page" refers to how the application works technically.

### How SPAs Work

In a traditional website, when you click a link to go to a new page:
1. Your browser sends a request to the server
2. The server sends back a completely new HTML page
3. Your browser loads and displays this new page

In an SPA:
1. The initial page loads with JavaScript code
2. When you navigate, JavaScript updates the page content without loading a new page
3. The URL changes, but the page doesn't fully reload

### SPA Example

Think of Gmail or Google Maps - when you click around, the page updates smoothly without the white flash you see on traditional websites. That's an SPA in action.

**Key characteristics of SPAs:**
- Fast navigation between pages (no page reloads)
- Smooth, app-like user experience
- All rendering happens in the browser
- Requires JavaScript to display content

## What is SSR?

**SSR** stands for **Server-Side Rendering**. This means the server generates the HTML content before sending it to the browser.

### How SSR Works

With SSR:
1. When someone visits your website, the server runs your application code
2. The server generates the complete HTML with all the content
3. The browser receives ready-to-display HTML
4. JavaScript then "hydrates" the page to make it interactive

### SSR Example

When you visit a news website like BBC or CNN, you can see the articles immediately, even before JavaScript loads. That's because the server pre-rendered the HTML with all the content.

**Key characteristics of SSR:**
- Content is visible immediately when the page loads
- Works even if JavaScript is disabled
- Better for search engines (SEO)
- Server does the initial rendering work

## SPA vs SSR: Key Differences

| Aspect | SPA | SSR |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Initial Load** | Slower (needs to download JavaScript first) | Faster (HTML is ready immediately) |
| **Navigation** | Very fast (no page reloads) | Slower (full page reloads) |
| **SEO** | Poor (search engines struggle with JavaScript) | Excellent (search engines see HTML content) |
| **Server Load** | Low (server just serves files) | Higher (server renders each page) |
| **Offline Support** | Good (can cache JavaScript app) | Limited (needs server for each page) |

## When to Use SPA?

SPAs work best for:

- **Admin panels and dashboards** - Users expect app-like interactions
- **Internal tools** - SEO isn't important, user experience is
- **Interactive applications** - Games, editors, complex forms
- **When you have a fast internet connection** - JavaScript downloads quickly

**Example use cases:**
- Company admin dashboard
- Online code editor
- Social media feed
- Real-time chat application

## When to Use SSR?

SSR works best for:

- **Public websites** - Need good SEO for search engines
- **Content-heavy sites** - Blogs, news sites, documentation
- **E-commerce** - Product pages need to be indexed by search engines
- **Mobile users** - Faster initial load on slower devices

**Example use cases:**
- Company blog or marketing website
- Online store product pages
- News or magazine website
- Documentation site (like this one!)

## Can You Have Both?

Yes! Many modern applications use a hybrid approach:

- **SSR for initial page load** - Fast loading and good SEO
- **SPA behavior after that** - Smooth navigation between pages

This gives you the best of both worlds. Vike makes this easy to implement.

## Real-World Examples

### SPA Examples
- Gmail (email interface)
- Figma (design tool)
- Discord (chat application)
- Notion (note-taking app)

### SSR Examples
- Wikipedia (content needs to be searchable)
- E-commerce product pages (SEO important)
- News websites (content-focused)
- This documentation site

### Hybrid Examples
- GitHub (initial page is SSR, navigation is SPA-like)
- Twitter/X (timeline loads fast, then becomes interactive)
- YouTube (video pages are SSR, but navigation is smooth)

## Getting Started with Vike

Vike makes it easy to build applications with SSR, SPA, or a combination of both. You can even configure different pages to use different rendering modes based on their needs.
