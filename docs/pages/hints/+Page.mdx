Hints for how to resolve common issues.


## `window is not defined`

The following error usually means that client-side code is wrongfully executed on the server-side.

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```
ReferenceError: window is not defined
    at someFunction (~/my-app/some/file.js:5:3)
    at someCallerFn (~/my-app/some/other-file.js:7:3)
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>

```js
// ~/my-app/some/file.js

// This file should be loaded only on the client-side

export function someFunction() {
  window.alert('hello')
}
```

```js
// ~/my-app/some/other-file.js

// This file is loaded on both client- and server-side

import { someFunction } from './file.js'

function someCallerFn() {
  someFunction()
}
```

The error, which is thrown by Node.js(/Bun/Deno), is that [the `window` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) is defined on the client-side only: Node.js doesn't know about `window` and therefore throws an error.

The solution is typically one of the following:
1. Make sure `someFunction()` is called only on the client-side:
   ```js
   // ~/my-app/some/other-file.js

   // This file is loaded on both client- and server-side

   import { someFunction } from './file.js'

   function someCallerFn() {
     someFunction()// [!code --]
   }
   ```
   ```js
   // ~/my-app/somewhere/else.js

   // This file is loaded on the client-side only.

   function someThirdFn() {
     // We can call someFunction() here.// [!code ++]
     someFunction()// [!code ++]
   }
   ```
1. Or make `someFunction()` <Link href="/glossary#isomorphic">isomorphic</Link>:
   ```js
   // ~/my-app/some/file.js

   // This file should be loaded only on the client-side// [!code --]
   // This file can be loaded on both client- and server-side// [!code ++]

   function someFunction() {
     window.alert('hello')// [!code --]
     if (isBrowser()) window.alert('hello')// [!code ++]
   }
   function isBrowser() {// [!code ++]
     return typeof window !== 'undefined'// [!code ++]
   }// [!code ++]
   ```

> We recommend the first approach whenever possible, because it's best to minimize isomorphic code to a strict minimum, for cleaner code and to avoid client-side bloat (loading server-side code on the client-side increases client bundle sizes and therefore slows down your app).

<Warning>
Another common technique is to define the `window` object on the server-side, for example with [`ssr-window`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssr-window), but we recommend against this approach because it may break a library that relies on `typeof window !== 'undefined'` to test whether the code is running on the client or server-side.
