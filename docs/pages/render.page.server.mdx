```ts
// Render the error page
render(statusCode: 401 | 403 | 404 | 429 | 500 | 503, abortReason?: unknown)
// Render another page (aka URL rewrite)
render(url: `/${string}`, abortReason?: unknown)
```

```js
import { render } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/abort'

function onSomeHook() {
  if (someCondition) {
    throw render('/login')
  }
  if (someOtherCondition) {
    throw render(401, "You don't have the permission to access this page.")
  }
}
```

- If the first argument is a URL, then that URL is rendered.
- If the first argument is a status code, then the <Link text="error page" href="/error-page" /> is rendered.
  - [`401` Unauthorized](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401) - Access denied, the user isn't logged in.
  - [`403` Forbidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403) - Access denied, the user is logged in but isn't allowed.
  - [`404` Not Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) - Page doesn't exist.
  - [`429` Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) - Purposefully not serving the request, because of rate limiting or to protect from [DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).
  - [`500` Internal Server Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) - App has a bug.
  - [`503` Service Unavailable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503) - Server is overloaded and/or a third-party API isn't responding.
- The `abortReason` argument sets `pageContext.abortReason` which is used by the error page to show a message to the user, see <Link href="/error-page" />.

While it's most commonly used with [`guard()`](/guard) or [`onBeforeRender()`](/onBeforeRender) you can use it with any hook.

Common use cases:

- Authentication and authorization, see <Link href="/auth#login-flow" doNotInferSectionTitle={true} />.
- Data fetching error handling, see <Link href="/data-fetching#error-handling" doNotInferSectionTitle={true} />.

If `throw render()` doesn't work, see <Link href="/abort#debug" />.
