The `render()` hook of `.page.server.js` has been renamed to `onRenderHtml()` for the V1 design.

> It's just a rename: the hook is equivalent and its documentation is the same as <Link href="/render-hook" />.
>
> The documentation will be moved to this page after the stable release of the V1 design.
