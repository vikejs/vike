## `create-vanjs`

We recommend using [create-vanjs](https://github.com/thednp/create-vanjs) which integrates [VanJS](https://www.vanjs.org) in a set of starter templates which include Vike.

> <UseBati>`vike-vanjs`</UseBati>

You can also <Link href="#custom-integration">integrate VanJS yourself</Link> if you want full control over the VanJS integration.


## Custom integration

Instead of using <Link href="/vike-vanjs">`vike-vanjs`</Link>, you can implement your own Solid integration, for full control over the integration of Solid and Solid libraries.

<CustomIntegrationWarning list={['vike-solid']} />
