The gift programs ensures everyone can use Vike.

If your team has limited resources, you can apply for the following programs:
- Free forever
- Extended free trial


## Who's eligible?

Your team is eligible if it has limited resources and purchasing a license key would be too expensive.

If you're expected to get more resources in the future, apply for an extended free trial. Otherwise, you can apply to use Vike for free forever.

You can also apply for an extended free trial for other reasons (e.g. pending clearance from your company's finance department).

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.
