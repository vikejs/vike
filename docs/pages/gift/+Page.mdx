The gift programs ensure everyone can use Vike.

There are two programs:
- Free forever
- Extended free trial


## Who's eligible?

Your team is eligible if it has limited resources and purchasing a license key would be too expensive.

If you expect to get more resources in the future, apply for an extended free trial. Otherwise, you can apply to use Vike for free forever.

>  Examples of eligible organizations:
> - Startup in its early days — every single dollar counts
> - Open Source project without (much) revenue
> - Amateur sports club website

You can also apply for an extended free trial for other reasons (e.g. pending clearance from your company's finance department).

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.
