The gift programs ensure everyone can use Vike.

There are two programs:
- Free forever
- Extended free trial


## Who's eligible?

Your team is eligible if it has limited resources and purchasing a license key would be too expensive.

> A good rule of thumb is the number of employees. For example, we consider an organization eligible if it has **fewer than 10 paid employees**. The threshold is **higher in countries with lower revenue**.

If you expect more resources in the future, apply for an extended free trial.

> Eligible examples:
> - Startup
> - Open Source project
> - Amateur sports club

You can also apply for an extended free trial for other reasons (e.g. pending clearance from your company's finance department).

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.
