The Open Source Pricing isn't implemented yet.

## What is it?

The *Open Source Pricing* is a novel business model built on these principles:

- ✅ **Fully open source**: 100% MIT License
- ✅ **Fully accessible**: everyone can use Vike, regardless of financial resources
- ✅ **Fully aligned interests**: a framework you can trust

## How does it work?

#### The idea

For small (or new) projects, you can use Vike just like any other open-source tool: 100% gratis and without any license key.

For larger projects, Vike shows a pesky toaster `Get your license key at ...` in development (it's never shown in production). You can remove it by purchasing a license key and adding it to `+config.js` or by setting the `VIKE_KEY` environment variable.

#### 100% Open Source

The npm package `vike` will adopt a proprietary license requiring companies to get a license key when they see the pesky toaster (see above). Vike's Git repository stays 100% MIT-licensed.

In theory, since Vike is 100% open source, you could fork it, remove the pesky toaster, and publish your own npm package. But maintaining a fork requires non-negligible effort &mdash; you might as well just apply for a free license key instead.

#### 100% offline

The implementation is 100% offline:
 - Uses asymmetric encryption to validate license keys.
 - Reads your Vike configuration (e.g. number of `+Page.js` files) and Git history (e.g. number of Git committers) to distinguish small apps from larger apps.

No telemetry, zero server requests.

Your privacy is fully respected. The only information Vike has about your company is when you purchase a license — just like a SaaS.


## Is Vike still Free Software?

Vike is still free as in "free speech" (not as in free beer), see explanations [by the Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and [by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

We believe in Libre Software and we invented the Open Source Pricing because <Link doNotInferSectionTitle href="#why-not-another-business-model" >other business models contradict Libre Software values</Link>.

Code remains not only 100% open source but also 100% accessible: we believe money (and the lack thereof) should never prevent anyone from using code.



## Why not another business model?

We believe other business models are flawed in fundamental ways.

The Open Source Pricing means:
- As an engineer, a much better software while everything stays 100% gratis.
- As a company, a transparent and sustainable relationship with a tool that is foundational to your stack.

Compared to other business models:

## Why zero-investors?

If a project accepts investor funding, it will eventually have to take radical decisions to generate massive amounts of revenue — typically aiming for $100 million annually which is the kind of return investors hope for when they invest.

This is often achieved with aggressive techniques such as vendor lock-in and steep fees. At the end of day, it will inevitably result in users having to pay a hefty bill in one form or another.

In contrast, the Open Source Pricing introduces a business relationship with users that is transparent, sustainable and stable.


## Do sponsors have to pay?

No, Vike stays 100% gratis for companies sponsoring Vike. Reach out and we will give you a free license key.


## How does it apply to monorepos?

It only applies to apps.

For example, in the following, it applies only to `my-app/` and `my-other-app/`.

```yaml
/packages/my-own-framework/
/packages/my-app/
/packages/my-other-app/
/packages/some-vike-component-wrapper/
```
