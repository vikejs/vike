Vike will soon introduce what we call an *Open Source Pricing*: a new kind of business model that keeps Vike open source, as well as accessible (so that everyone, regardless of financial resources, can use Vike).

- The entire code **stays 100% open source** (MIT License).
- Everything **stays 100% gratis for engineers**. You don't need any license key and you get the full Vike experience without any restriction, just like any other open soure tool.
- **Companies pay a small amount:**
  - **Pay what you can**. Companies can choose the amount they want to pay while we trust them to make a fair choice. (If too many pay too little, we may switch to a fixed pricing.)
  - **Free trial**. If your Vike app is new or small, Vike is gratis and you don't need any license key: everything works just like any other open source tool.
  - **Apply for a free license key**.  You can apply for a free license key if your team cannot afford one or didn't incorporate a company yet. Write two or three sentences explaining your situation and we'll give you a free license key valid for six months (you can apply again after six months).

The Open Source Pricing is a major milestone for Vike's growth. It preserves what makes open source special while ensuring Vike's priorities are aligned with your interests through a transparent and sustainable relationship.


### How does it work?

For new or small projects nothing changes: you can use Vike just like any other open source tool for free and without any license key.

For larger projects, Vike shows a pesky toaster in production `Get your license key at ...` which you can remove by purchasing a license key and installing it with `$ vike add-key 4f7DK1q29X5WJ6G3b9t1`.

In theory, since Vike is 100% open source, you can fork Vike and remove the pesky toaster. But we'll make the pesky toaster difficult to find &mdash; more difficult than applying for a free license key.


### We are sponsoring Vike, do we need to pay?

No, Vike stays free if your company is sponsoring Vike (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum). Reach out and we'll give you a free license key.
