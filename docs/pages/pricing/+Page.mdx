Vike will soon introduce what we call an *Open Source Pricing*: a new kind of business model that keeps Vike open source, as well as accessible (so that everyone, regardless of financial resources, can use Vike).

- The entire code **stays 100% open source** (MIT License).
- Everything **stays 100% gratis for engineers**. You don't need any license key and you can use Vike without any restrictions, just like any other open source tool.
- **For companies:**
  - **Pay what you can**. Companies choose the amount they want to pay while we trust them to make a fair choice. (If too many pay too little, we may switch to a fixed pricing.)
  - **Free for small apps**. For new and small Vike apps, Vike is 100% gratis and you don't need any license key: everything works just like any other open source tool.
  - **Apply for a free license key**. For larger apps, you can apply for a free license key if your team cannot afford one or didn't incorporate a company yet. Write two or three sentences explaining your situation and we will give you a free license key.

The Open Source Pricing is a major milestone for Vike's growth. It preserves what makes open source special while aligning Vike's priorities with user interests, fostering a transparent and sustainable relationship.

### Free tier

Vike's free tier cut-off is determined by what we call the *double-three-threshold*:

- **`>=3` regular committers for the past `>=3` months**

Consequently, Vike is free for:

- Small projects. (Maintained by `<=2` regular committers.)
- Large projects in their infancy. (With a 3-month free trial from the moment the project starts having `>=3` regular committers.)
- Finished projects. (They can be maintained for free by up to two full-time developers.)

If you are within the free tier then **you don't need any license key**: you can use Vike just like any other open source tool. See also <Link href="#how-does-it-work" />

> Occasional contributors (bots, designers, technical managers, etc.) are ignored: they aren't counted as "regular committers".


### Recommendation

The table above is only a recommendation and you can choose any other amount instead &mdash; we trust companies to make a fair choice.

> **Don't hesitate to apply for a free license key** if you have `>=3` regular committers but haven't incorporated yet, just want to experiment, or have a use case you believe should be free.
>
>Keeping Vike accessible to everyone is a primary objective of the Open Source Pricing.

Size estimations:

- **Small organization**: 0-20 employees.
- **Midsize organization**: 20-70 employees.
- **Large organization**: >70 employees. (Also counting the employees of parent companies.)

<div style={{ marginTop: -15, height: 1 }}/>

- **Hobby use case**: Vike is used for experimenting.
- **Small use case**: Vike is used for developing a **project that plays only a marginal role** for your company. For example a landing page or a simple internal app.
- **Midsize use case**: Vike is used for developing a **project that plays only a minor role**. For example a one-shot Vike usage for a significant internal app.
- **Large use case**: Vike is used for developing a **project that plays a significant role**. For example an app with many users or building your own internal framework.




## Do sponsors have to pay?

No, Vike stays 100% gratis for companies sponsoring Vike. Reach out and we will give you a free license key.


## How does it apply to monorepos?

It only applies to apps.

For example, in the following, it applies only to `my-app/` and `my-other-app/`.

```bash
/packages/my-own-framework/
/packages/my-app/
/packages/my-other-app/
/packages/some-vike-component-wrapper/
```

## How does it work?

For new or small projects, you can use Vike just like any other open-source tool: 100% gratis and without any license key.

For larger projects, Vike shows a pesky toaster `Get your license key at ...` in development (it's never shown in production) that you can remove by purchasing a license key. You install the key by adding it to your `+config.js` file, or by setting the `VIKE_KEY` environment variable.

Also, the npm package `vike` will adopt a proprietary license requiring companies outside the free tier to purchase a license key. Vike's Git repository stays 100% MIT-licensed.

In theory, since Vike is 100% open source, you could fork it, remove the pesky toaster, and build your own npm package. But maintaining a fork requires effort &mdash; you might as well apply for a free license key which is much easier.

On the the npm package `vike` side, th Open Source pricing works 100% offline: it uses asymmetric encryption to validate license keys, and reads your Git history to distinguish small apps from larger apps. It doesn't send any telemetry nor server requests.


## Why zero-investors?

If a project accepts investor funding, it will eventually have to take radical decisions to generate massive amounts of revenue â€” typically aiming for $100 million annually which is the kind of return investors hope for when they invest.

This is often achieved with aggressive techniques such as vendor lock-in and steep fees. At the end of day, it will inevitably result in users having to pay a hefty bill in one form or another.

In contrast, the Open Source Pricing introduces a business relationship with users that is transparent, sustainable and stable.


## Is Vike still Free Software?

Vike is still free as in "free speech" (not as in free beer), see explanations [by the Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and [by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

We believe in Libre Software and we invented the Open Source Pricing because <Link doNotInferSectionTitle href="#why-not-another-business-model" >other business models contradict Libre Software values</Link>.

Code remains not only 100% open source but also 100% accessible: we believe money (and the lack thereof) should never prevent anyone from using code.



## Why not another business model?

We believe other business models are flawed in fundamental ways.

The Open Source Pricing means:
- As an enginner, a much better software while everything stays 100% gratis.
- As a company, a transparent and sustainable relationship with a tool that is foundational to your stack.

Compared to other business models:
