The gift program ensures everyone can use Vike:
- <Link href="#free-forever" />
- <Link href="#extended-free-trial" />


## Who's eligible?

You're eligible if your team has limited resources and purchasing a license key would be too expensive.

If your team is expected to get more resources in the future, apply for an extended free trial instead. If not, you can apply to use Vike for free forever.

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.
