There are two gift programs to ensure everyone can use Vike:

- <Link href="#limited-resources" />
- <Link href="#extended-free-trial" />

## Limited resources

Teams with limited resources are eligible to use Vike for free, forever.

You're eligible if:
- Your team has limited resources
- <Link href="/pricing">Purchasing a license key</Link> is too expensive for your team

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to <Link href="/pricing/gift/apply">apply</Link> which is quick and easy.

## Extended free trial
