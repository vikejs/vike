The gift program ensures everyone can use Vike.

If your team has limited resources, you can apply for:
- Free forever
- Extended free trial


## Who's eligible?

You're eligible if your team has limited resources and purchasing a license key would be too expensive.

If your team is expected to get more resources in the future, apply for an extended free trial instead. If not, you can apply to use Vike for free forever.

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.
