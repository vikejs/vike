The gift program ensures everyone can use Vike:
- <Link href="#free-forever" />
- <Link href="#extended-free-trial" />

We tend to be generous, so don't hesitate to apply — it's easy and quick.


## Who's eligible?

Teams with limited resources are eligible to use Vike for free, forever.

If your team is expected to get more resources in the future, consider requesting an extended free trial instead.

You're eligible if:
- Your team has limited resources
- <Link href="/pricing">Purchasing a license key</Link> is too expensive for your team
