By default, Photon uses a built-in server that supports basic features like SSR. If you need additional server functionalities (e.g. [file uploads](https://hono.dev/examples/file-upload) or <Link href="/api-routes">API routes</Link>), then <Link href="/vike-photon#server">create your own server</Link>.
